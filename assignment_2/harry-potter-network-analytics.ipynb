      "harry potter and the sorcerers stone chapter one the boy who lived and of number privet were proud to say that they were perfectly thank you very they were the last people youd expect to be involved in anything strange or because they just didnt hold with such dursley was the director of a firm called which made he was a beefy man with hardly any although he did have a very large dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden spying on the the dursleys had a small son called dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy the dursleys had everything they but they also had a and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover they didnt think they could bear it if anyone found out about the potter was dursleys but they hadnt met for several in dursley pretended she didnt have a because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as undursleyish as it was possible to the dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the potters arrived in the the dursleys knew that the potters had a small but they had never even seen this boy was another good reason for keeping the potters they didnt want dudley mixing with a child like when and dursley woke up on the gray tuesday our story there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for and dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming dudley into his high none of them noticed a tawny owl flutter past the at half past dursley picked up his pecked dursley on the and tried to kiss dudley good bye but because dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the chortled dursley as he left the he got into his car and backed out of number fours it was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar a cat reading a for a dursley didnt realize what he had seen then he jerked his head around to look there was a tabby cat standing on the corner of privet but there wasnt a map in what could he have been thinking it must have been a trick of the dursley blinked and stared at the it stared as dursley drove around the corner and up the he watched the cat in his it was now reading the sign that said privet drive looking at the cats couldnt read maps or dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his as he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that but on the edge of drills were driven out of his mind by something as he sat in the usual morning traffic he couldnt help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people people in dursley couldnt bear people who dressed in funny clothes the getups you saw on young he supposed this was some stupid new he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close they were whispering excitedly dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them werent young at that man had to be older than he and wearing an emerald green the nerve of but then it struck dursley that this was probably some silly stunt these people were obviously collecting for that would be the traffic moved on and a few minutes dursley arrived in the grunnings parking his mind back on dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth if he he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that he didnt see the owls swoop ing past in broad though people down in the street they pointed and gazed open mouthed as owl after owl sped most of them had never seen an owl even at had a perfectly owl free he yelled at five different he made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit he was in a very good mood until when he thought hed stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the hed forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the he eyed them angrily as he he didnt know but they made him this bunch were whispering and he couldnt see a single collecting it was on his way back past clutching a large doughnut in a that he caught a few words of what they were thats thats what i heard their dursley stopped fear flooded he looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to but thought better of he dashed back across the hurried up to his snapped at his secretary not to disturb seized his and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his he put the receiver back down and stroked his he was being potter wasnt such an unusual he was sure there were lots of people called potter who had a son called come to think of he wasnt even sure his nephew was called hed never even seen the it might have been or there was no point in worrying she always got so upset at any mention of her he didnt blame her if hed had a sister like but all the those people in he found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the he as the tiny old man stumbled and almost it was a few seconds before dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet he didnt seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the on the his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby be my dear for nothing could upset me for you know who has gone at even muggles like yourself should be this happy and the old man hugged dursley around the middle and walked dursley stood rooted to the he had been hugged by a complete he also thought he had been called a whatever that he was he hurried to his car and set off for hoping he was imagining which he had never hoped because he didnt approve of as he pulled into the driveway of number the first thing he saw and it didnt improve his mood was the tabby cat hed spotted that it was now sitting on his garden he was sure it was the same it had the same markings around its said dursley the cat didnt it just gave him a stern was this normal cat dursley trying to pull himself he let himself into the he was still determined not to mention anything to his dursley had had a normal she told him over dinner all about next doors problems with her daughter and how dudley had learned a new word dursley tried to act when dudley had been put to he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening bird watchers everywhere have reported that the nations owls have been behaving very unusually although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping the newscaster allowed himself a and over to jim mcguffin with the going to be any more showers of owls said the dont know about but its not only the owls that have been acting oddly viewers as far apart as and dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain i promised theyve had a downpour of shooting perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early its not until next but i can promise a wet night dursley sat frozen in his shooting stars all over owls flying by mysterious people in cloaks all over the and a a whisper about the dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of it was no hed have to say something to he cleared his throat dear you havent heard from your sister have as he had dursley looked shocked and after they normally pretended she didnt have a she said stuff on the dursley shooting and there were a lot of funny looking people in town snapped i just it was something to do you her dursley sipped her tea through pursed dursley wondered whether he dared tell her hed heard the name he decided he didnt instead he as casually as he son hed be about dudleys age wouldnt suppose said dursley his name isnt common if you ask said his heart sinking i quite he didnt say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to while dursley was in the dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front the cat was still it was staring down privet drive as though it were waiting for was he imagining could all this have anything to do with the if it if it got out that they were related to a pair of he didnt think he could bear the dursleys got into dursley fell asleep quickly but dursley lay turning it all over in his his comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the potters were there was no reason for them to come near him and the potters knew very well what he and petunia thought about them and their he couldnt see how he and petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on he yawned and turned over it couldnt affect how very wrong he dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of it was sitting as still as a its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of privet it didnt so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next nor when two owls swooped in it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at a man appeared on the corner the cat had been appeared so suddenly and silently youd have thought hed just popped out of the the cats tail twitched and its eyes nothing like this man had ever been seen on privet he was and very judging by the silver of his hair and which were both long enough to tuck into his he was wearing long a purple cloak that swept the and high buckled his blue eyes were and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and as though it had been broken at least this mans name was albus albus dumbledore didnt seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was he was busy rummaging in his looking for but he did seem to realize he was being because he looked up suddenly at the which was still staring at him from the other end of the for some the sight of the cat seemed to amuse he chuckled and should have he found what he was looking for in his inside it seemed to be a silver cigarette he flicked it held it up in the and clicked the nearest street lamp went out with a little he clicked it again the next lamp flickered into twelve times he clicked the put until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the which were the eyes of the cat watching if anyone looked out of their window even beady eyed they wouldnt be able to see anything that was happening down on the dumbledore slipped the put outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number where he sat down on the wall next to the he didnt look at but after a moment he spoke to seeing you professor he turned to smile at the but it had instead he was smiling at a rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its was wearing a an emerald her black hair was drawn into a tight she looked distinctly did you know it was she dear i ve never seen a cat sit so be stiff if youd been sitting on a brick wall all said professor when you could have been i must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way professor mcgonagall sniffed everyones all she said think theyd be a bit more but no even the muggles have noticed somethings going it was on their she jerked her head back at the dursleys dark living room heard flocks of shooting theyre not completely they were bound to notice shooting stars down in kent ill bet that was dedalus he never had much cant blame said dumbledore had precious little to celebrate for eleven know said professor mcgonagall thats no reason to lose our people are being downright out on the streets in broad not even dressed in muggle swapping she threw a sideways glance at dumbledore as though hoping he was going to tell her but he so she went fine thing it would be on the very day youknow who seems to have disappeared at the muggles found out about us i suppose he really has certainly seems said have much to be thankful would you care for a lemon lemon theyre a kind of muggle sweet im rather fond thank said professor mcgonagall as though she didnt think this was the moment for lemon i even if you know who has gone dear surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his all this you know who nonsense for eleven years i have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper professor mcgonagall but who was unsticking two lemon seemed not to all gets so confusing if we keep saying you know i have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying voldemorts know you haven said professor sounding half half youre everyone knows youre the only one you know all was frightened flatter said dumbledore had powers i will never because youre too well noble to use lucky its i havent blushed so much since madam pomfrey told me she liked my new professor mcgonagall shot a sharp look at dumbledore and owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying you know what everyones about why hes about what finally stopped it seemed that professor mcgonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to the real reason she had been waiting on a hard wall all for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did it was plain that whatever was she was not going to believe it until dumbledore told her it was was choosing another lemon drop and did not theyre she pressed that last night voldemort turned up in godrics he went to find the the rumor is that lily and james potter are are that theyre dumbledore bowed his professor mcgonagall and i cant believe i didnt want to believe dumbledore reached out and patted her on the i he said professor mcgonagalls voice trembled as she went not theyre saying he tried to kill the potters but he he couldnt kill that little no one knows or but theyre saying that when he couldnt kill harry voldemorts power somehow broke and thats why hes dumbledore nodded its faltered professor all hes all the people hes he couldnt kill a little its just of all the things to stop but how in the name of heaven did harry can only said may never professor mcgonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it was a very odd it had twelve hands but no little planets were moving around the it must have made sense to because he put it back in his pocket and i suppose it was he who told you id be by the said professor i dont suppose youre going to tell me why youre of all come to bring harry to his aunt and theyre the only family he has left dont mean you cant mean the people who live cried professor jumping to her feet and pointing at number you ive been watching them all you couldnt find two people who are less like and theyve got this son i saw him kicking his mother all the way up the screaming for harry potter come and live the best place for said dumbledore aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when hes ive written them a repeated professor mcgonagall sitting back down on the you think you can explain all this in a these people will never understand hell be famous a legend i wouldnt be surprised if today was known as harry potter day in the future there will be books written about harry every child in our world will know his said looking very seriously over the top of his half moon would be enough to turn any boys famous before he can walk and famous for something he wont even cara you see how much better off hell growing up away from all that until hes ready to take professor mcgonagall opened her changed her and then youre of but how is the boy getting she eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding harry underneath bringing think it wise to trust hagrid with something as important as i would trust hagrid with my said not saying his heart isnt in the right said professor mcgonagall you cant pretend hes not he does tend to what was a low rumbling sound had broken the silence around it grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of if the motorcycle was it was nothing to the man sitting astride he was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as he looked simply too big to be and so wild long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his he had hands the size of trash can and his feet in their leather boots were like baby in his muscular arms he was holding a bundle of said sounding and where did you get that professor said the climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he sirius black lent it to ive got were sir house was almost but i got him out all right before the muggles started swarmin he fell asleep as we was flyin over dumbledore and professor mcgonagall bent forward over the bundle of just was a baby fast under a tuft of jet black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped like a bolt of that where whispered professor said have that scar you do something about if i i scars can come in i have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the london well give him hagrid wed better get this over dumbledore took harry in his arms and turned toward the dursleys i could i say good bye to asked he bent his shaggy head over harry and gave him what must have been a very whiskery hagrid let out a howl like a wounded hissed professor wake the s sobbed taking out a spotted handkerchief and burying his face in i c c cant stand it lily an james dead an poor little harry off ter live with muggles its all very but get a grip on or well be professor mcgonagall patting hagrid gingerly on the arm as dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front he laid harry gently on the took a letter out of his tucked it inside harrys and then came back to the other for a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little hagrids shoulders professor mcgonagall blinked and the twinkling light that usually shone from dumbledores eyes seemed to have gone said dumbledore weve no business staying we may as well go and join the said hagrid in a very muffled be takin sirius his bike professor mcgonagall professor wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into with a roar it rose into the air and off into the shall see you i professor said nodding to professor mcgonagall blew her nose in dumbledore turned and walked back down the on the corner he stopped and took out the silver put he clicked it and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that privet drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the he could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number he he turned on his heel and with a swish of his he was a breeze ruffled the neat hedges of privet which lay silent and tidy under the inky the very last place you would expect astonishing things to harry potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking one small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept not knowing he was not knowing he was not knowing he would be woken in a few hours time by dursleys scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin he couldnt know that at this very people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed harry potter the boy who chapter two the vanishing glass nearly ten years had passed since the dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front but privet drive had hardly changed at the sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the dursleys front it crept into their living which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when dursley had seen that fateful news report about the only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had ten years there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different colored bonnets but dudley dursley was no longer a and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first on a carousel at the playing a computer game with his being hugged and kissed by his the room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the yet harry potter was still asleep at the but not for his aunt petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the get harry woke with a his aunt rapped on the door she harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the he rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been it had been a good there had been a flying motorcycle in he had a funny feeling hed had the same dream his aunt was back outside the you up she said get a move i want you to look after the and dont you dare let it i want everything perfect on duddys harry did you his aunt snapped through the dudleys birthday how could he have harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for he found a pair under his bed after pulling a spider off one of put them harry was used to because the cupboard under the stairs was full of and that was where he when he was dressed he went down the hall into the the table was almost hidden beneath all dudleys birthday it looked as though dudley had gotten the new computer he not to mention the second television and the racing exactly why dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to as dudley was very fat and hated exercise unless of course it involved punching dudleys favorite punching bag was but he couldnt often catch harry didnt look but he was very perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark but harry had always been small and skinny for his he looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of and dudley was about four times bigger than he harry had a thin knobbly black and bright green he wore round glasses held together with a lot of scotch tape because of all the times dudley had punched him on the the only thing harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of he had had it as long as he could and the first question he could ever remember asking his aunt petunia was how he had gotten the car crash when your parents she had dont ask dont ask questions that was the first rule for a quiet life with the uncle vernon entered the kitchen as harry was turning over the your he by way of a morning about once a uncle vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that harry needed a harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put but it made no his hair simply grew that way all over the harry was frying eggs by the time dudley arrived in the kitchen with his dudley looked a lot like uncle he had a large pink not much watery blue and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his fat aunt petunia often said that dudley looked like a baby angel harry often said that dudley looked like a pig in a harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the which was difficult as there wasnt much was counting his his face he looking up at his mother and two less than last you havent counted auntie marges its here under this big one from mommy and thirty seven said going red in the who could see a huge dudley tantrum coming began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case dudley turned the table aunt petunia obviously scented because she said well buy you another two presents while were out hows two more is that all right dudley thought for a it looked like hard finally he said ill have thirty said aunt dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest right uncle vernon tyke wants his moneys just like his atta he ruffled dudleys at that moment the telephone rang and aunt petunia went to answer it while harry and uncle vernon watched dudley unwrap the racing a video a remote control sixteen new computer and a he was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when aunt petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and she figgs broken her she cant take she jerked her head in harrys dudleys mouth fell open in but harrys heart gave a every year on dudleys his parents took him and a friend out for the to adventure hamburger or the every harry was left behind with a mad old lady who lived two streets harry hated it the whole house smelled of cabbage and figg made him look at photographs of all the cats shed ever said aunt looking furiously at harry as though hed planned harry knew he ought to feel sorry that figg had broken her but it wasnt easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at and tufty could phone uncle vernon be she hates the the dursleys often spoke about harry like as though he wasnt there or as though he was something very nasty that couldnt understand like a about whats her your friend vacation in snapped aunt could just leave me harry put in hopefully be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on dudleys aunt petunia looked as though shed just swallowed a come back and find the house in she wont blow up the said but they werent suppose we could take him to the said aunt petunia and leave him in the cars hes not sitting in it dudley began to cry in he wasnt really crying it had been years since hed really cried but he knew that if he screwed up his face and his mother would give him anything he dont mummy wont let him spoil your special she flinging her arms around t t to dudley yelled between pretend always sp spoils he shot harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers just the doorbell rang good theyre said aunt petunia frantically and a moment dudleys best piers walked in with his piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a he was usually the one who held peoples arms behind their backs while dudley hit dudley stopped pretending to cry at half an hour who couldnt believe his was sitting in the back of the dursleys car with piers and on the way to the for the first time in his his aunt and uncle hadnt been able to think of anything else to do with but before theyd uncle vernon had taken harry warning he had putting his large purple face right up close to warning you boy any funny anything at all and youll be in that cupboard from now until not going to do said but uncle vernon didnt believe no one ever the problem strange things often happened around harry and it was just no good telling the dursleys he didnt make them aunt tired of harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadnt been at had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his which she left hide that horrible dudley had laughed himself silly at who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped next he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before aunt petunia had sheared it off he had been given a week in his cupboard for even though he had tried to explain that he couldnt explain how it had grown back so another aunt petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of dudleys with orange puff the harder she tried to pull it over his the smaller it seemed to until finally it might have fitted a hand but certainly wouldnt fit aunt petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash to his great harry wasnt on the other hed gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school dudleys gang had been chasing him as usual as much to harrys surprise as anyone there he was sitting on the the dursleys had received a very angry letter from harrys headmistress telling them harry had been climbing school but all hed tried to do he shouted at uncle vernon through the locked door of his was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid but nothing was going to go it was even worth being with dudley and piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasnt his or figgs cabbage smelling living while he uncle vernon complained to aunt he liked to complain about people at the the and harry were just a few of his favorite this it was roaring along like the young he as a motorcycle overtook i had a dream about a said remembering was uncle vernon nearly crashed into the car in he turned right around in his seat and yelled at his face like a gigantic beet with a dont dudley and piers i know they said was only a but he wished he hadnt said if there was one thing the dursleys hated even more than his asking it was his talking about anything acting in a way it no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon they seemed to think he might get dangerous it was a very sunny saturday and the was crowded with the dursleys bought dudley and piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and because the smiling lady in the van had asked harry what he wanted before they could hurry him they bought him a cheap lemon ice it wasnt harry licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like except that it wasnt harry had the best morning hed had in a long he was careful to walk a little way apart from the dursleys so that dudley and who were starting to get bored with the animals by wouldnt fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting they ate in the and when dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didnt have enough ice cream on uncle vernon bought him another one and harry was allowed to finish the harry that he should have known it was all too good to after lunch they went to the reptile it was cool and dark in with lit windows all along the behind the all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and dudley and piers wanted to see poisonous cobras and man crushing dudley quickly found the largest snake in the it could have wrapped its body twice around uncle vernons car and crushed it into a trash can but at the moment it didnt look in the in it was fast dudley stood with his nose pressed against the staring at the glistening brown it he whined at his uncle vernon tapped on the but the snake didnt it dudley uncle vernon rapped the glass smartly with his but the snake just snoozed is dudley he shuffled harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the he wouldnt have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day it was worse than having a cupboard as a where the only visitor was aunt petunia hammering on the door to wake you at least he got to visit the rest of the the snake suddenly opened its beady very it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with it harry then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was they he looked back at the snake and the snake jerked its head toward uncle vernon and then raised its eyes to the it gave harry a look that said quite get that all the harry murmured through the though he wasnt sure the snake could hear must be really the snake nodded do you come harry the snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the harry peered at boa it nice the boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and harry read this specimen was bred in the i see so youve never been to as the snake shook its a deafening shout behind harry made both of them come and look at this you wont believe what its dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he of the he punching harry in the caught by harry fell hard on the concrete what came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened one piers and dudley were leaning right up close to the the they had leapt back with howls of harry sat up and the glass front of the boa constrictors tank had the great snake was uncoiling itself slithering out onto the people throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the as the snake slid swiftly past harry could have sworn a hissing voice here i the keeper of the reptile house was in the he kept did the glass the director himself made aunt petunia a cup of sweet tea while he apologized over and over piers and dudley could only as far as harry had the snake hadnt done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it but by the time they were all back in uncle vernons dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his while piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to but worst of for harry at was piers calming down enough to was talking to werent uncle vernon waited until piers was safely out of the house before starting on he was so angry he could hardly he managed to cupboard stay no before he collapsed into a and aunt petunia had to run and get him a large harry lay in his dark cupboard much wishing he had a he didnt know what time it was and he couldnt be sure the dursleys were asleep until they he couldnt risk sneaking to the kitchen for some hed lived with the dursleys almost ten ten miserable as long as he could ever since hed been a baby and his parents had died in that car he couldnt remember being in the car when his parents had when he strained his memory during long hours in his he came up with a strange a blinding flash of green light and a burn ing pain on his he was the though he couldnt imagine where all the green light came he couldnt remember his parents at his aunt and uncle never spoke about and of course he was forbidden to ask there were no photographs of them in the when he had been harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him but it had never the dursleys were his only yet sometimes he thought maybe that strangers in the street seemed to know very strange strangers they a tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with aunt petunia and after asking harry furiously if he knew the aunt petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying a wild looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a a bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a the weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second harry tried to get a closer at harry had no everybody knew that dudleys gang hated that odd harry potter in his baggy old clothes and broken and nobody liked to disagree with dudleys chapter three the letters from no one the escape of the brazilian boa constrictor earned harry his longest ever by the time he was allowed out of his cupboard the summer holidays had started and dudley had already broken his new video crashed his remote control first time out on his racing knocked down old figg as she crossed privet drive on her harry was glad school was but there was no escaping dudleys who visited the house every single and gordon were all big and but as dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the he was the the rest of them were all quite happy to join in dudleys favorite harry this was why harry spent as much time as possible out of the wandering around and thinking about the end of the where he could see a tiny ray of when september came he would be going off to secondary school for the first time in his he wouldnt be with dudley had been accepted at uncle vernons old private piers polkiss was going there on the other was going to stonewall the local public dudley thought this was very stuff peoples heads down the toilet the first day at he told to come upstairs and said poor toilets never had anything as horrible as your head down it it might be then he before dudley could work out what hed one day in aunt petunia took dudley to london to buy his smeltings leaving harry at figg wasn t as bad as it turned out shed broken her leg tripping over one of her and she didnt seem quite as fond of them as she let harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though shed had it for several that dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand new smeltings boys wore maroon orange and flat straw hats called they also carried knobbly used for hitting each other while the teachers werent this was supposed to be good training for later as he looked at dudley in his new uncle vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his aunt petunia burst into tears and said she couldnt believe it was her ickle he looked so handsome and grown harry didnt trust himself to he thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to there was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when harry went in for it seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the he went to have a the tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray he asked aunt her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a new school she harry looked in the bowl he didnt realize it had to be so be snapped aunt dyeing some of dudleys old things gray for itll look just like everyone elses when ive harry seriously doubted but thought it best not to he sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at stonewall high like he was wearing bits of old elephant dudley and uncle vernon came both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from harrys new uncle vernon opened his newspaper as usual and dudley banged his smelting which he carried on the they heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the the said uncle vernon from behind his harry get the dudley get him with your smelting harry dodged the smelting stick and went to get the three things lay on the a postcard from uncle vernons sister who was vacationing on the isle of a brown envelope that looked like a and a letter for harry picked it up and stared at his heart twanging like a giant elastic no in his whole had written to who he had no no other relatives he didnt belong to the so hed never even got rude notes asking for books yet here it a addressed so plainly there could be no potter the cupboard under the stairs privet drive little whinging surrey the envelope was thick and made of yellowish and the address was written in emerald green there was no turning the envelope his hand harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of a an a and a snake surrounding a large letter shouted uncle vernon from the are you checking for letter he chuckled at his own harry went back to the still staring at his he handed uncle vernon the bill and the sat and slowly began to open the yellow uncle vernon ripped open the snorted in and flipped over the he informed aunt a funny said dudley harrys got harry was on the point of unfolding his which was written on the same heavy parchment as the when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by uncle said trying to snatch it be writing to sneered uncle shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at his face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic and it didnt stop within seconds it was the grayish white of old p he dudley tried to grab the letter to read but uncle vernon held it high out of his aunt petunia took it curiously and read the first for a moment it looked as though she might she clutched her throat and made a choking oh my goodness they stared at each seeming to have forgotten that harry and dudley were still in the dudley wasnt used to being he gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his smelting want to read that he said want to read said harry its both of croaked uncle stuffing the letter back inside its harry didnt i want my he me see demanded roared uncle and he took both harry and dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the slamming the kitchen door behind harry and dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the dudley so his glasses dangling from one lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and aunt petunia was saying in a quivering at the address how could they possibly know where he you dont think theyre watching the spying might be following muttered uncle vernon what should we should we write tell them we dont want harry could see uncle vernons shiny black shoes pacing up and down the he said well ignore if they dont get an thats we wont do not having one in the didnt we swear when we took him in wed stamp out that dangerous that evening when he got back from uncle vernon did something hed never done he visited harry in his my said the moment uncle vernon had squeezed through the writing to it was addressed to you by said uncle vernon have burned was not a said harry had my cupboard on yelled uncle and a couple of spiders fell from the he took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a which looked quite harry about this your aunt and i have been youre really getting a bit big for we think it might be nice if you moved into dudleys second said ask snapped his this stuff the dursleys house had four one for uncle vernon and aunt one for visitors uncle vernons one where dudley and one where dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldnt fit into his first it only took harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this he sat down on the bed and stared around nearly everything in here was the month old video camera was lying on top of a working tank dudley had once driven over the next door neighbors in the corner was dudleys first ever television which hed put his foot through when his favorite program had been there was a large which had once held a parrot that dudley had swapped at school for a real air which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because dudley had sat on other shelves were full of they were the only things in the room that looked as though theyd never been from downstairs came the sound of dudley bawling at his i dont want him in i need that make him get harry sighed and stretched out on the yesterday hed have given anything to be up today hed rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without next morning at everyone was rather dudley was in hed whacked his father with his smelting been sick on kicked his and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse and he still didnt have his room harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing hed opened the letter in the uncle vernon and aunt petunia kept looking at each other when the mail uncle who seemed to be trying to be nice to made dudley go and get they heard him banging things with his smelting stick all the way down the then he another the smallest privet drive with a strangled uncle vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the harry right behind uncle vernon had to wrestle dudley to the ground to get the letter from which was made difficult by the fact that harry had grabbed uncle vernon around the neck from after a minute of confused in which everyone got hit a lot by the smelting uncle vernon straightened gasping for with harrys letter clutched in his to your cupboard i your he wheezed at go just harry walked round and round his new someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadnt received his first surely that meant theyd try and this time hed make sure they didnt he had a the repaired alarm clock rang at six oclock the next harry turned it off quickly and dressed he mustnt wake the he stole downstairs without turning on any of the he was going to wait for the postman on the corner of privet drive and get the letters for number four his heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door harry leapt into the hed trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat something lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror harry realized that the squashy something had been his uncles uncle vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping clearly making sure that harry didnt do exactly what hed been trying to he shouted at harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got the mail had right into uncle vernons harry could see three letters addressed in green i want he but uncle vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his uncle vernon didnt go to work that he stayed at home and nailed up the mail he explained to aunt petunia through a mouthful of they cant deliver them theyll just give not sure thatll these peoples minds work in strange theyre not like you and said uncle trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake aunt petunia had just brought on no less than twelve letters arrived for as they couldnt go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the slotted through the and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs uncle vernon stayed at home after burning all the he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go he hummed through the as he and jumped at small on things began to get out of twenty four letters to harry found their way into the rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed aunt petunia through the living room while uncle vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain aunt petunia shredded the letters in her food on earth wants to talk to you this dudley asked harry in on sunday uncle vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather but post on he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his damn letters today something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the next thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like the dursleys but harry leapt into the air trying to catch uncle vernon seized harry around the waist and threw him into the when aunt petunia and dudley had run out with their arms over their uncle vernon slammed the door they could hear the letters still streaming into the bouncing off the walls and does said uncle trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same i want you all back here in five minutes ready to were going just pack some no he looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded up doors and were in the speeding toward the dudley was sniffling in the back his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his and computer in his sports they and they even aunt petunia didnt dare ask where they were every now and then uncle vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a shake em he would mutter whenever he did they didnt stop to eat or drink all by nightfall dudley was hed never had such a bad day in his he was hed missed five television programs hed wanted to and hed never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his uncle vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy looking hotel on the outskirts of a big dudley and harry shared a room with twin beds and musty dudley snored but harry stayed sitting on the staring down at the lights of passing cars and they ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next they had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their but is one of you only i got about an undred of these at the front she held up a letter so they could read the green ink potter room railview hotel cokeworth harry made a grab for the letter but uncle vernon knocked his hand out of the the woman take said uncle standing up quickly and following her from the dining wouldnt it be better just to go aunt petunia suggested hours but uncle vernon didnt seem to hear exactly what he was looking none of them he drove them into the middle of a got looked shook his got back in the and off they went the same thing happened in the middle of a plowed halfway across a suspension and at the top of a multilevel parking gone hasnt dudley asked aunt petunia dully late that uncle vernon had parked at the locked them all inside the and it started to great drops beat on the roof of the dud ley he told his great humbertos on i want to stay somewhere with a this reminded harry of if it was monday and you could usually count on dudley to know the days the because of television then was harrys eleventh of his birthdays were never exactly fun last the dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of uncle vernons old you werent eleven every uncle vernon was back and he was he was also carrying a thin package and didnt answer aunt petunia when she asked what hed the perfect he everyone it was very cold outside the uncle vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could one thing was there was no television in forecast for said uncle vernon clapping his hands this gentlemans kindly agreed to lend us his a toothless old man came ambling up to with a rather wicked at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron gray water below already got us some said uncle all it was freezing in the icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their after what seemed like hours they reached the where uncle slipping and led the way to the broken down the inside was it smelled strongly of the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden and the fireplace was damp and there were only two uncle vernons rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four he tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled do with some of those letters he said he was in a very good obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver harry privately though the thought didnt cheer him up at as night the promised storm blew up around spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy aunt petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for dudley on the moth eaten she and uncle vernon went off to the lumpy bed next and harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the most ragged the storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went harry couldnt he shivered and turned trying to get his stomach rumbling with dudleys snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near the lighted dial of dudleys which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat told harry hed be eleven in ten minutes he lay and watched his birthday tick wondering if the dursleys would remember at wondering where the letter writer was five minutes to harry heard something creak he hoped the roof wasnt going to fall although he might be warmer if it four minutes to maybe the house in privet drive would be so full of letters when they got back that hed be able to steal one three minutes to was that the slapping hard on the rock like and minutes to what was that funny crunching was the rock crumbling into the one minute to go and hed be thirty twenty nine maybe hed wake dudley just to annoy him the whole shack shivered and harry sat bolt staring at the someone was knocking to come chapter four the keeper of the keys they knocked dudley jerked the he said there was a crash behind them and uncle vernon came skidding into the he was holding a rifle in his hands now they knew what had been in the thin package he had brought with he warn you im there was a then the door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the a giant of a man was standing in the his face was almost completely hidden by a shaggy mane of hair and a tangled but you could make out his glinting like black beetles under all the the giant squeezed his way into the stooping so that his head just brushed the he bent picked up the and fitted it easily back into its the noise of the storm outside dropped a he turned to look at them make us a cup o could its not been an easy he strode over to the sofa where dudley sat frozen with yeh great said the dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his who was behind uncle heres said the harry looked up into the shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a time i saw you was only a said the look a lot like yet but yehve got yet moms uncle vernon made a funny rasping i demand that you leave at he are breaking and shut yeh great said the he reached over the back of the jerked the gun out of uncle vernons bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of and threw it into a corner of the uncle vernon made another funny like a mouse being trodden said the turning his back on the very happy birthday to got summat fer yeh here i mighta sat on it at some but itll taste all from an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed harry opened it with trembling inside was a sticky chocolate cake with happy birthday harry written on it in green harry looked up at the he meant to say thank but the words got lost on the way to his and what he said instead are the giant i havent introduced rubeus keeper of keys and grounds at he held out an enormous hand and shook harrys whole about that tea he rubbing his hands not say no ter summat stronger if yehve got his eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he he bent down over the they couldnt see what he was doing but when he drew back a second there was a roaring fire it filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and harry felt the warmth wash over him as though hed sunk into a hot the giant sat back down on the which sagged under his and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his a copper a squashy package of a a several chipped and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling nobody said a thing while the giant was but as he slid the first six slightly burnt sausages from the dudley fidgeted a uncle vernon said touch anything he gives the giant chuckled great puddin of a son don need fattenin don he passed the sausages to who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so but he still couldnt take his eyes off the as nobody seemed about to explain he but i still dont really know who you the giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his me he an like i told im keeper of keys at hogwarts yehll know all about o said hagrid looked harry said barked turning to stare at the who shrank back into the s them as should be i knew yeh werent gettin yer letters but i never thought yeh wouldnt even know abou fer cryin out did yeh never wonder where yet parents learned it asked hagrid wait jus one he had leapt to his in his

bewildered don know what yeh he said uncle vernon suddenly found his he right i forbid you to tell the boy a braver man than vernon dursley would have quailed under the furious look hagrid now gave when hagrid his every syllable trembled with never told never told him what was in the letter dumbledore left fer i was i saw dumbledore leave an youve kept it from him all these what from said harry i forbid yelled uncle vernon in aunt petunia gave a gasp of go boil yet both of said yet a there was silence inside the only the sea and the whistling wind could be a gasped o said sitting back down

take the yellowish addressed in emerald green to the hut on the the he pulled out the letter and hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry albus dumbledore of first grand supreme international of

tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that harry could read upside dear professor given harry his taking him to buy his things weathers hope youre hagrid hagrid rolled up the gave it to the which clamped it in its went to the and threw the owl out into the then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the harry realized his mouth was open and closed it was said but at that uncle still ashen faced but looking very moved into the not he hagrid like ter see a great muggle like you stop he said said what we call nonmagic folk like an its your bad luck you grew up in a family o the biggest muggles i ever laid eyes swore when we took him in wed put a stop to that said uncle wed stamp it out of wizard said knew im a a shrieked aunt petunia of course we how could you not my dratted sister being what she she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that that school and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog turning teacups into i was the only one who saw her for what she was a but for my mother and oh it was lily this and lily they were proud of having a witch in the she stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting it seemed she had been wanting to say all this for she met that potter at school and they left and got married and had and of course i knew youd be just the just as just as as abnormal and if you she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with harry had gone very as soon as he found his voice he you told me they died in a car roared jumping up so angrily that the dursleys scuttled back to their could a car crash kill lily an james its an a harry potter not knowin his own story when every kid in our world knows his what harry asked the anger faded from hagrids he looked suddenly never expected he in a worried had no when dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin hold of how much yeh didnt i don know if im the right person ter tell yeh but someone s gotta yeh cant go off ter hogwarts not he threw a dirty look at the its best yeh know as much as i can tell yeh i cant tell yeh its a great parts of he sat stared into the fire for a few and then i with with a person called but its incredible yeh dont know his everyone in our world knows i don like sayin the name if i can help no one people are still this is there was this wizard who as bad as you could worse than his name hagrid but no words came you write it harry cant spell all right hagrid make me say it this this about twenty years ago started lookin fer got too some were some just wanted a bit o his cause he was gettin himself all dark didnt know who ter didnt dare get friendly with strange wizards or terrible things he was takin some stood up to him an he killed one o the only safe places left was reckon dumbledores the only one you know who was afraid didnt dare try takin the not jus yer mum an dad were as good a witch an wizard as i ever head boy an girl at hogwarts in their suppose the mystry is why you know who never tried to get em on his side probably knew they were too close ter dumbledore ter want anythin ter do with the dark he thought he could persuade maybe he just wanted em outta the all anyone knows he turned up in the village where you was all on halloween ten years you was just a year he came ter yer house an an hagrid suddenly pulled out a very spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a he its that sad knew yer mum an an nicer people yeh couldnt find know who killed an then an this is the real mystry of the thing he tried to kill wanted ter make a clean job of i or maybe he just liked killin by but he couldnt do never wondered how you got that mark on yer that was no ordinary thats what yeh get when a evil curse touches yeh took care of yer mum an dad an yer even but it didnt work on an thats why yer no one ever lived after he decided ter kill no one except an hed killed some o the best witches an wizards of the age the the the prewetts an you was only a an you something very painful was going on in harrys as hagrids story came to a he saw again the blinding flash of green more clearly than he had ever remembered it before and he remembered something for the first time in his a cruel hagrid was watching him yeh from the ruined house on dumbledores brought yeh ter this of old said uncle harry he had almost forgotten that the dursleys were uncle vernon certainly seemed to have got back his he was glaring at hagrid and his fists were you listen he accept theres something strange about probably nothing a good beating wouldnt have cured and as for all this about your they were no denying and the worlds better off without them in my opinion asked for all they getting mixed up with these wizarding types just what i always knew theyd come to a sticky end but at that hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his pointing this at uncle vernon like a he warning dursley im warning you one more in danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded uncle vernons courage failed he flattened himself against the wall and fell said breathing heavily and sitting back down on the which this time sagged right down to the still had questions to hundreds of what happened to vol sorry i you know same night he tried ter kill makes yeh even more thats the biggest he was gettin more an more powerful whyd he say he in my dunno if he had enough human left in him to some say hes still out bidin his but i don believe people who was on his side came back ter some of em came outta kinda don~ reckon they couldve done if he was comin of us reckon hes still out there somewhere but lost his too weak to carry cause somethin about you finished there was somethin goin on that night he hadnt counted on i dunno what it no one does but somethin about you stumped all hagrid looked at harry with warmth and respect blazing in his but instead of feeling pleased and felt quite sure there had been a horrible a how could he possibly hed spent his life being clouted by and bullied by aunt petunia and uncle if he was really a why hadnt they been turned into warty toads every time theyd tried to lock him in his if hed once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the how come dudley had always been able to kick him around like a he said think you must have made a i dont think i can be a to his hagrid a never made things happen when you was scared or harry looked into the now he came to think about every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when had been upset or chased by dudleys he had somehow found himself out of their dreading going to school with that ridiculous hed managed to make it grow and the very last time dudley had hit hadnt he got his without even realizing he was doing hadnt he set a boa constrictor on harry looked back at and saw that hagrid was positively beaming at said not a wizard you youll be right famous at but uncle vernon wasnt going to give in without a i told you hes not he going to stonewall high and hell be grateful for ive read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish spell books and wands and he wants ter a great muggle like you wont stop growled lily an james potter s son goin ter yer his names been down ever since he was hes off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the seven years there and he wont know hell be with youngsters of his own fer a an hell be under the greatest headmaster hogwarts ever had albus dumbled am not paying for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic yelled uncle but he had finally gone too hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his he insult albus dumbledore in front of he brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at dudley there was a flash of violet a sound like a a sharp and the next dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat howling in when he turned his back on harry saw a curly pigs tail poking through a hole in his uncle vernon pulling aunt petunia and dudley into the other he cast one last terrified look at hagrid and slammed the door behind hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his lost me he said it didnt work meant ter turn him into a but i suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasnt much left ter he cast a sideways look at harry under his bushy grateful if yeh didnt mention that ter anyone at he er not supposed ter do strictly i was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an get yer letters to yeh an stuff one o the reasons i was so keen ter take on the job arent you supposed to do asked well i was at hogwarts meself but i er got ter tell yeh the in me third they snapped me wand in half an but dumbledore let me stay on as great were you gettin late and weve got lots ter do said hagrid get up ter get all yer books an he took off his thick black coat and threw it to can kip under he mind if it wriggles a i think i still got a couple o dormice in one o the chapter five diagon alley harry woke early the next although he could tell it was he kept his eyes shut was a he told himself dreamed a giant called hagrid came to tell me i was going to a school for when i open my eyes ill be at home in my there was suddenly a loud tapping and theres aunt petunia knocking on the harry his heart but he still didnt open his it had been such a good harry getting he sat up and hagrids heavy coat fell off the hut was full of the storm was hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed and there was an owl rapping its claw on the a newspaper held in its harry scrambled to his so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside he went straight to the window and jerked it the owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of who didnt wake the owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack hagrids do harry tried to wave the owl out of the but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the said harry an owl hagrid grunted into the wants payin fer deliverin the look in the hagrids coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets bunches of slug balls of peppermint harry pulled out a handful of strange looking him five said hagrid little bronze harry counted out five little bronze and the owl held out his leg so harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to then he flew off through the open hagrid yawned sat and be lots ter do gotta get up ter london an buy all yer stuff fer harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at he had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a said who was pulling on his huge havent got any money and you heard uncle vernon last night he wont pay for me to go and learn worry about

under deep under the yehd die of hunger tryin ter get even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on harry sat and thought about this while hagrid read his the daily harry had learned from uncle vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did but it was very hed never had so many questions in his o magic messin things up as hagrid turning the a ministry of harry before he could stop said wanted dumbledore fer but hed never leave so old cornelius fudge got the bungler if ever there was so he pelts dumbledore with owls every askin fer what does a ministry of magic their main job is to keep it from the muggles that theres still witches an wizards up an down the everyoned be wantin magic solutions to their were best left at this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor hagrid folded up his and they clambered up the stone steps onto the passersby stared a lot at hagrid as they walked through the little town to the harry couldnt blame not only was hagrid twice as tall as anyone he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying things these muggles dream said panting a bit as he ran to keep you say there are dragons at so they said id like a like one ever since i was a kid here we they had reached the there was a train to london in five minutes who didnt understand as he called gave the bills to harry so he could buy their people stared more than ever on the hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary yellow circus got yer he asked as he counted harry took the parchment envelope out of his said a list there of

there in an ordinary he got stuck in the ticket barrier on the and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too dont know how the muggles manage without he said as they climbed a broken down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd all harry had to do was keep close behind they passed book shops and music hamburger restaurants and but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic this was just an ordinary street full of ordinary could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath were there really shops that sold spell books and might this not all be some huge joke that the dursleys had cooked if harry hadnt known that the dursleys had no sense of he might have thought yet even though everything hagrid had told him so far was harry couldnt help trusting is said coming to a leaky its a famous it was a grubby looking if hagrid hadnt pointed it harry wouldnt have noticed it was the people hurrying by didnt glance at their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldnt see the leaky cauldron at in harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and hagrid could see before he could mention hagrid had steered him for a famous it was very dark and a few old women were sitting in a drinking tiny glasses of one of them was smoking a long a little man in a top hat was talking to the old who was quite bald and looked like a toothless the low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked everyone seemed to know they waved and smiled at and the bartender reached for a im on hogwarts said clapping his great hand on harrys shoulder and making harrys knees said the peering at this can this be the leaky cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and my whispered the old what an he hurried out from behind the rushed toward harry and seized his tears in his welcome harry didnt know what to everyone was looking at the old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone hagrid was then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the leaky cant believe im meeting you at im just so wanted to shake your hand im all of a just cant tell diggles the dedalus seen you said as dedalus diggles top hat fell off in his bowed to me once in a cried dedalus looking around at you hear he remembers harry shook hands again and again doris crockford kept coming back for a pale young man made his way very one of his eyes was said professor quirrell

professor quirrell keep harry to it took almost ten minutes to get away from them at hagrid managed to make himself heard over the get on lots ter come doris crockford shook harrys hand one last and hagrid led them through the bar and out into a walled where there was nothing but a trash can and a few hagrid grinned at didnt told yeh you was even professor quirrell was tremblin ter meet yeh mind hes usually he always that poor brilliant he was fine while he was studyin outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand they say he met vampires in the black and there was a nasty bit o trouble with a hag never been the same scared of the scared of his own subject wheres me harrys head was was counting bricks in the wall above the trash two across he stand he tapped the wall three times with the point of his the brick he had touched quivered it wriggled in the a small hole appeared it grew wider and wider a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of said diagon he grinned at harrys they stepped through the harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid the sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest cauldrons all sizes silver self stirring said a sign hanging over youll be needin said we gotta get yer money harry wished he had about eight more he turned his head in every direction as they walked up the trying to look at everything at the the things outside the people doing their a plump woman outside an apothecary was shaking her head as they seventeen sickles an theyre a soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying eeylops owl emporium and several boys of about harrys age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in harry heard one of them new nimbus two thousand fastest ever there were shops selling shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments harry had never seen windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels tottering piles of spell and rolls of potion globes of the said they had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little standing beside its burnished bronze wearing a uniform of scarlet and was thats a said hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward the goblin was about a head shorter than he had a clever a pointed beard harry very long fingers and he bowed as they walked now they were facing a second pair of silver this with words engraved upon but take heed of what awaits the sin of for those who but do not must pay most dearly in their so if you seek beneath our floors a treasure that was never you have been beware of finding more than treasure i yehd be mad ter try an rob said a pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble about a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long scribbling in large weighing coins in brass examining precious stones through there were too many doors to count leading off the and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of hagrid and harry made for the said hagrid to a free come ter take some money outta harry potters have his it here said and he started emptying his pockets onto the scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of the goblin wrinkled his harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing said hagrid at holding up a tiny golden the goblin looked at it seems to be in ive also got a letter here from professor said hagrid throwing out his about the youknow what in vault seven hundred and the goblin read the letter he handing it back to will have someone take you down to both griphook was yet another once hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his he and harry followed griphook toward one of the doors leading off the the you know what in vault seven hundred and harry tell yeh said hagrid hogwarts dumbledores trusted moren my jobs worth ter tell yeh griphook held the door open for who had expected more was they were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming it sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward they climbed in hagrid with some difficulty and were at first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting harry tried to middle but it was the rattling cart seemed to know its own because griphook wasnt harrys eyes stung as the cold air rushed past but he kept them wide he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a but too late they plunged even passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and i never harry called to hagrid over the noise of the the difference between a stalagmite and a got an m in said don ask me questions just i think im gonna be he did look very and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from griphook unlocked the a lot of green smoke came billowing and as it harry inside were mounds of gold columns of heaps of little bronze smiled all harrys it was the dursleys couldnt have known about this or theyd have had it from him faster than how often had they complained how much harry cost them to and all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to buried deep under hagrid helped harry pile some of it into a gold ones are he silver sickles to a galleon and twenty nine knuts to a its easy that should be enough fer a couple o well keep the rest safe for he turned to seven hundred and thirteen and can we go more speed said they were going even deeper now and gathering the air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight they went rattling over an underground and harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark but hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his vault seven hundred and thirteen had no said griphook he stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted anyone but a gringotts goblin tried theyd be sucked through the door and trapped in said often do you check to see if anyones harry once every ten said griphook with a rather nasty something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security harry was and he leaned forward expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least but at first he thought it was then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his harry longed to know what it but knew better than to back in this infernal and dont talk to me on the way its best if i keep me mouth said one wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside harry didnt know where to run first now that he had a bag full of he didnt have to know how many galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than hed had in his whole life more money than even dudley had ever as well get yer said nodding toward madam malkins robes for all would yeh mind if i slipped off fer a pick me up in the leaky i hate them gringotts he did still look a bit so harry entered madam malkins shop feeling madam malkin was a smiling witch dressed all in she when harry started to the lot here another young man being fitted up just in in the back of the a boy with a pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black madam malkin stood harry on a stool next to slipped a long robe over his and began to pin it to the right said the said fathers next door buying my books and mothers up the street looking at said the he had

bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you when they had left the he whats i keep forgettin how little yeh know not knowin about make me feel said he told hagrid about the pate boy in madam and he said people from muggle families shouldnt even be allowed not from a muggle if hed known who yeh were hes grown up knowin yer name if his parents are wizardin you saw what everyone in the leaky cauldron was like when they saw what does he know about some o the best i ever saw were the only ones with magic in em in a long line muggles look at yer look what she had fer a what is our wizard its like like soccer in the muggle world everyone follows quidditch played up in the air on broomsticks and theres four balls sorta hard ter explain the what are slytherin and theres everyone says hufflepuff are a lot o but bet im in said harry hufflepuff than said hagrid not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasnt in you know who was sorry you know who was at an years said they bought harrys school books in a shop called flourish and blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in books the size of postage stamps in covers of books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at even who never read would have been wild to get his hands on some of hagrid almost had to drag harry away from curses and countercurses your friends and befuddle your enemies with the latest hair jelly tongue tying and much by professor vindictus was trying to find out how to curse not sayin thats not a good but yer not ter use magic in the muggle world except in very special said yeh couldn work any of them curses yehll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that hagrid wouldnt let harry buy a solid gold either says pewter on yer but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass then they visited the which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible a mixture of bad eggs and rotted barrels of slimy stuff stood on the jars of dried and bright powders lined the bundles of strings of and snarled claws hung from the while hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty one galleons each and glittery black beetle eyes knuts a outside the hagrid checked harrys list yer wand left a an i still havent got yeh a birthday harry felt himself go dont have to know i dont have tell yeh ill get yer not a toads went outta fashion years yehd be laughed at an i don like they make me ill get yer an all the kids want theyre dead carry yer mail an twenty minutes they left eeylops owl which had been dark and full of rustling and jewel bright harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy fast asleep with her head under her he couldnt stop stammering his sounding just like professor mention said hagrid expect youve had a lotta presents from them just ollivanders left now only place fer and yeh gotta have the best a magic this was what harry had been really looking forward the last shop was narrow and peeling gold letters over the door read makers of fine wands since a single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty a tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped it was a tiny empty except for a spindly chair that hagrid sat on to harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the for some the back of his neck the very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret said a soft harry hagrid must have because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly an old man was standing before his pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the said harry said the i thought id be seeing you harry it wasnt a have your mothers it seems only yesterday she was in here buying her first ten and a quarter inches made of nice wand for charm ollivander moved closer to harry wished he would those silvery eyes were a bit on the other favored a mahogany eleven a little more power and excellent for i say your father favored it its really the wand that chooses the of ollivander had come so close that he and harry were almost nose to harry could see himself reflected in those misty thats ollivander touched the lightning scar on harrys forehead with a white sorry to say i sold the wand that did he said and a half powerful very and in the wrong if id known what that wand was going out into the world to he shook his head and to harrys spotted rubeus how nice to see you sixteen rather wasnt said that but i suppose they snapped it in half when you got said suddenly they said shuffling his still got the he added you dont use said ollivander said hagrid harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he said giving hagrid a piercing now let me he pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his is your wand im right said out your thats he measured harry from shoulder to then wrist to shoulder to knee to armpit and round his as he he ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical we use unicorn phoenix tail and the heartstrings of no two ollivander wands are the just as no two or phoenixes are quite the and of you will never get such good results with another wizards harry suddenly realized that the tape which was measuring between his was doing this on its ollivander was flitting around the taking down will he and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the try this beechwood and dragon nine nice and just take it and give it a harry took the wand and waved it around a but ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at and phoenix seven quite try harry tried but he had hardly raised the wand when was snatched back by no ebony and unicorn eight and a half go go try it harry and he had no idea what ollivander was waiting the pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly but the more wands ollivander pulled from the the happier he seemed to not to well find the perfect match here somewhere i now why not unusual combination holly and phoenix eleven nice and harry took the he felt a sudden warmth in his he raised the wand above his brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a throwing dancing spots of light on to the hagrid whooped and clapped and ollivander very how how very he put harrys wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown still said whats ollivander fixed harry with his pale remember every wand ive ever every single it so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your gave another feather just one it is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother its brother gave you that harry thirteen and a half curious indeed how these things the wand chooses the i think we must expect great things from after he who must not be named did great things but harry he wasnt sure he liked ollivander too he paid seven gold galleons for his and ollivander bowed them from his the late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as harry and hagrid made their way back down diagon back through the back through the leaky now harry didnt speak at all as they walked down the he didnt even notice how much people were gawking at them on the laden as they were with all their funny shaped with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on harrys up another out into paddington harry only realized where they were when hagrid tapped him on the time fer a bite to eat before yer train he he bought harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat harry kept looking everything looked so all yer very said harry wasnt sure he could hed just had the best birthday of his life and yet he chewed his trying to find the thinks im he said at those people in the leaky professor but i dont know anything about magic at how can they expect great im famous and i cant even remember what im famous i dont know what happened when vol sorry i the night my parents hagrid leaned across the behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind you youll learn fast everyone starts at the beginning at youll be just just be i know its yehve been singled an thats always but yehll have a great time at hogwarts i did still smatter of hagrid helped harry on to the train that would take him back to the then handed him an ticket fer he o september kings cross its all on yer any problems with the send me a letter with yer shell know where to find see yeh the train pulled out of the harry wanted to watch hagrid until he was out of he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the but he blinked and hagrid had chapter six the journey from platform nine and three quarters harrys last month with the dursleys wasnt dudley was now so scared of harry he wouldnt stay in the same while aunt petunia and uncle vernon didnt shut harry in his force him to do or shout at him in they didnt speak to him at half half they acted as though any chair with harry in it were although this was an improvement in many it did become a bit depressing after a harry kept to his with his new owl for he had decided to call her a name he had found in a history of his school books were very he lay on his bed reading late into the hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she it was lucky that aunt petunia didnt come in to vacuum because hedwig kept bringing back dead every night before he went to harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the counting down to september the on the last day of august he thought hed better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to kings cross station the next so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on he cleared his throat to let them know he was and dudley screamed and ran from the uncle uncle vernon grunted to show he was i need to be at kings cross tomorrow to to go to uncle vernon grunted it be all right if you gave me a harry supposed that meant he was about to go back upstairs when uncle vernon actually way to get to a wizards the magic carpets all got have harry didnt say is this dont said realizing this for the first he pulled the ticket hagrid had given him out of his just take the train from platform nine and three quarters at eleven he his aunt and uncle and three talk said uncle is no platform nine and three on my said uncle the lot of youll you just all well take you to kings were going up to london tomorrow or i wouldnt are you going to harry trying to keep things dudley to the growled uncle to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to harry woke at five oclock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to he got up and pulled on his jeans because he didnt want to walk into the station in his wizards robes hed change on the he checked his hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he saw that hedwig was shut safely in her and then paced the waiting for the dursleys to get two hours harrys heavy trunk had been loaded into the dursleys aunt petunia had talked dudley into sitting next to and they had set they reached kings cross at half past uncle vernon dumped harrys trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for harry thought this was strangely kind until uncle vernon stopped facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his there you platform nine platform your platform should be somewhere in the but they dont seem to have built it do he was quite of there was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to and in the nothing at a good said uncle vernon with an even nastier he left without another harry turned and saw the dursleys drive all three of them were harrys mouth went rather what on earth was he going to he was starting to attract a lot of funny because of hed have to ask he stopped a passing but didnt dare mention platform nine and three the guard had never heard of hogwarts and when harry couldnt even tell him what part of the country it was he started to get as though harry was being stupid on getting harry asked for the train that left at eleven but the guard said there wasnt in the end the guard strode muttering about time harry was now trying hard not to according to the large clock over the arrivals he had ten minutes left to get on the train to hogwarts and he had no idea how to do he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly a pocket full of wizard and a large hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to like tapping the third brick on the left to get into diagon he wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspectors stand between platforms nine and at that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were packed with of course harry swung the speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four all with flaming red each of them was pushing a trunk like harrys in front of him and they had an heart harry pushed his cart after they stopped and so did just near enough to hear what they were whats the platform said the boys and three piped a small also red who was holding her cant i not old now be all you go what looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and harry careful not to blink in case he missed it but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared the boy had you the plump woman not im said the you call yourself our cara you tell im i am said the and off he his twin called after him to hurry and he must have done because a second he had gone but how had he done now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there and quite he wasnt there was nothing else for harry said to the plump she time at rons she pointed at the last and youngest of her he was and with big hands and and a long said thing is the thing i dont know how to to get onto the she said and harry to she you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and dont stop and dont be scared youll crash into thats very best do it at a bit of a run if youre go go now before said he pushed his trolley around and stared at the it looked very he started to walk toward people jostled him on their way to platforms nine and harry walked more he was going to smash right into that barrier and then hed be in trouble leaning forward on his he broke into a heavy run the barrier was coming nearer and nearer he wouldnt be able to stop the cart was out of control he was a foot away he closed his eyes ready for the crash it didnt he kept on he opened his a scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with a sign overhead said hogwarts eleven harry looked behind him and saw a wrought iron archway where the barrier had with the words platform nine and three quarters on he had done smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering while cats of every color wound here and there between their owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy the first few carriages were already packed with some hanging out of the window to talk to their some fighting over harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty he passed a round faced boy who was ive lost my toad he heard the old woman a boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small us a go the boy lifted the lid of a box in his and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a hairy harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the he put hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train he tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his a it was one of the red haired twins hed followed through the harry cmere and with the twins harrys trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the said pushing his sweaty hair out of his said one of the twins pointing at harrys lightning said the other you said the first he added to said the said i the two boys gawked at and harry felt himself turning to his a voice came floating in through the trains open are you with a last look at the twins hopped off the harry sat down next to the window half he could watch the red haired family on the platform and hear what they were their mother had just taken out her youve got something on your the youngest boy tried to jerk out of the but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his he wriggled has ickle ronnie got somefink on his said one of the said said their coming the oldest boy came striding into he had already changed into his billowing black hogwarts and harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter p on stay he up the prefects have got two compartments to themselves are you a said one of the with an air of great should have said we had no i think i remember him saying

window for her to kiss them good and their younger sister began to well send you loads of send you a hogwarts toilet the train began to harry saw the boys mother waving and their half half running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much then she fell back and harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the houses flashed past the harry felt a great leap of he didnt know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving the door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came sitting he pointing at the seat opposite else is harry shook his head and the boy sat he glanced at harry and then looked quickly out of the pretending he hadnt harry saw he still had a black mark on his the twins were were going down the middle of the train lee jordans got a giant tarantula down mumbled said the other we introduce fred and george and this is our see you said harry and the twins slid the compartment door shut behind you

hagrid told i didnt know anything about be ing a wizard or about my parents or ron said said you know whos said sounding both shocked and have thought of all people not trying to be brave or saying the said i just never knew you see what i ive got loads to i he voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot bet im the worst in the wont theres loads of people who come from muggle families and they learn quick while they had been the train had carried them out of now they were speeding past fields full of cows and they were quiet for a watching the fields and lanes flick around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a dimpled woman slid back their door and off the who hadnt had any leapt to his but rons ears went pink again and he muttered that hed brought harry went out into the he had never had any money for candy with the and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many mars bars as he could carry but the woman didnt have mars what she did have were bettie botts every flavor droobles best blowing chocolate pumpkin cauldron licorice and a number of other strange things harry had never seen in his not wanting to miss he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver sickles and seven bronze ron stared as harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty are said taking a large bite out of a pumpkin ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped there were four sandwiches he pulled one of them apart and always forgets i dont like corned

that dumbledores face had you cant expect him to hang around all said be ive got morgana again and ive got about six of do you want you can start rons eyes strayed to the pile of chocolate frogs waiting to be said you the muggle people just stay put in they dont move at ron sounded harry stared as dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the famous witches and wizards but harry couldnt keep his eyes off soon he had not only dumbledore and but hengist of alberic and he finally tore his eyes away from the druidess who was scratching her to open a bag of bertie botts every flavor want to be careful with ron warned they say every they mean every flavor you you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar but then you can get spinach and liver and george reckons he had a booger flavored one ron picked up a green looked at it and bit into a they had a good time eating the every flavor harry got baked and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one ron wouldnt which turned out to be the countryside now flying past the window was becoming the neat fields had now there were twisting and dark green there was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round faced boy harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came he looked he have you seen a toad at when they shook their he lost he keeps getting away from turn said said the boy if you see he know why hes so said id brought a toad id lose it as quick as i mind i brought so i cant the rat

wondering what a wizard did once hed finished in romania studying and bills in africa doing something for said you hear about its been all over the daily but i dont suppose you get that with the muggles someone tried to rob a high security harry what happened to thats why its such big they havent been my dad says it mustve been a powerful dark wizard to get round but they dont think they took thats whats everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case you know whos behind harry turned this news over in his he was starting to get a prickle of fear every time you know who was he supposed this was all part of entering the magical but it had been a lot more comfortable saying without your quidditch ron i dont know harry ron looked you its the best game in the world and he was explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven describing famous games hed been to with his brothers and the broomstick hed like to get if he had the he was just taking harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet but it wasnt neville the toadless or hermione granger this three boys and harry recognized the middle one at it was the pale boy from madam malkins robe he was looking at harry with a lot more interest than hed shown back in diagon it he saying all down the train that harry potters in this so its is said he was looking at the other both of them were thickset and looked extremely standing on either side of the pale they looked like this is crabbe and this is said the pale boy noticing where harry was my names draco ron gave a slight which might have been hiding a draco malfoy looked at my names do no need to ask who you my father told me all the weasleys have red and more children than they can he turned back to soon find out some wizarding families are much better than you dont want to go making friends with the wrong i can help you he held out his hand to shake but harry didnt take think i can tell who the wrong sort are for he said draco malfoy didnt go but a pink tinge appeared in his pale be careful if i were he said youre a bit politer youll go the same way as your they didnt know what was good for you hang around with riffraff like the weasleys and that and itll rub off on both harry and ron stood that ron his face as red as his youre going to fight are malfoy you get out said more bravely than he because crabbe and goyle were a lot bigger than him or we dont feet like do weve eaten all our food and you still seem to have goyle reached toward the chocolate frogs next to ron ron leapt but before hed so much as touched goyle let out a horrible scabbers the rat was hanging off his sharp little teeth sunk deep into goyles knuckle crabbe and malfoy backed away as goyle swung scabbers round and and when scabbets finally flew off and hit the all three of them disappeared at perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the or perhaps theyd heard because a second hermione granger had come has been going she looking at the sweets all over the floor and ron picking up scabbers by his i think hes been knocked ron said to he looked closer at i dont believe it hes gone back to sleep and so he met malfoy harry explained about their meeting in diagon heard of his said ron were some of the first to come back to our side after you know who said theyd been my dad doesnt believe

havent been have youll be in trouble before we even get has been not said scowling at you mind leaving while we right i only came in here because people outside are behaving very racing up and down the said hermione in a sniffy youve got dirt on your by the did you ron glared at her as she harry peered out of the it was getting he could see mountains and forests under a deep purple the train did seem to be slowing he and ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black rons were a bit short for you could see his sneakers underneath a voice echoed through the will be reaching hogwarts in five minutes please leave your luggage on the it will be taken to the school harrys stomach lurched with nerves and he looked pale under his they crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the the train slowed right down and finally people pushed their way toward the door and out on to a dark harry shivered in the cold night then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the and harry heard a familiar firs years over all right hagrids big hairy face beamed over the sea of follow me any more firs mind yer firs years follow slipping and they followed hagrid down what seemed to be a narrow it was so dark on either side of them that harry thought there must be thick trees nobody spoke the boy who kept losing his sniffed once or all get yer firs sight o hogwarts in a hagrid called over his round this bend there was a loud the narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black perched atop a high mountain on the other its windows sparkling in the starry was a vast castle with many turrets and moren four to a hagrid pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the harry and ron were followed into their boat by neville and shouted who had a boat to then and the fleet of little boats moved off all at gliding across the which was as smooth as everyone was staring up at the great castle it towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it yelled hagrid as the first boats reached the they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff they were carried along a dark which seemed to be taking them right underneath the until they reached a kind of underground where they clambered out onto rocks and you is this your said who was checking the boats as people climbed out of cried neville holding out his then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after hagrids coming out at last onto damp grass right in the shadow of the they walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the oak front you still got yer hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle chapter seven the sorting hat the door swung open at a black haired witch in emerald green robes stood she had a very stern face and harrys first thought was that this was not someone to firs professor said i will take them from she pulled the door the entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the dursleys house in the stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at the ceiling was too high to make and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper they followed professor mcgonagall across the flagged stone harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right the rest of the school must already be here but professor mcgonagall showed the first years into a empty chamber off the they crowded standing rather closer together than they would usually have peering about to said professor start of term banquet will begin but before you take your seats in the great you will be sorted into your the sorting is a very important ceremony while you are your house will be something like your family within you will have classes with the rest of your sleep in your house and spend free time in your house common four houses are called and each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and while you are at your triumphs will earn your house while any rulebreaking will lose house at the end of the the house with the most points is awarded the house a great i hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes sorting ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the i suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are her eyes lingered for a moment on nevilles which was fastened under his left and on rons smudged harry nervously tried to flatten his shall return when we are ready for said professor wait she left the harry exactly do they sort us into he asked sort of i fred said it hurts a but i think he was harrys heart gave a horrible a in front of the whole but he didnt know any magic yet what on earth would he have to he hadnt expected something like this the moment they he looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked no one was talking much except hermione who was whispering very fast about all the spells shed learned and wondering which one shed harry tried hard not to listen to hed never been more not even when hed had to take a school report home to the dursleys saying that hed somehow turned his teachers wig he kept his eyes fixed on the any second professor mcgonagall would come back and lead him to his then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air several people behind him the he so did the people around about twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back pearly white and slightly they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first they seemed to be what looked like a fat little monk was and i we ought to give him a second chance dear havent we given peeves all the chances he he gives us all a bad name and you hes not really even a ghost i what are you all doing a ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first nobody said the fat smiling around at to be i a few people nodded to see you in said the old you along said a sharp sorting ceremonys about to professor mcgonagall had one by the ghosts floated away through the opposite form a professor mcgonagall told the first follow feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to harry got into line behind a boy with sandy with ron behind and they walked out of the back across the and through a pair of double doors into the great harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid it was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long where the rest of the students were these tables were laid with glittering golden plates and at the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were professor mcgonagall led the first years up so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other with the teachers behind the hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering dotted here and there among the the ghosts shone misty mainly to avoid all the staring harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with he heard hermione bewitched to look like the sky i read about it in a it was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at and that the great hall didnt simply open on to the harry quickly looked down again as professor mcgonagall silently placed a four legged stool in front of the first on top of the stool she put a pointed wizards this hat was patched and frayed and extremely aunt petunia wouldnt have let it in the maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of harry thought that seemed the sort of thing noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the he stared at for a few there was complete then the hat a rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth and the hat began to you may not think im but dont judge on what you ill eat myself if you can find a smarter hat than you can keep your bowlers your top hats sleek and for im the hogwarts sorting hat and i can cap them theres nothing hidden in your head the sorting hat cant so try me on and i will tell you where you ought to you might belong in where dwell the brave at their and chivalry set gryffindors you might belong in where they are just and those patient hufflepuffis are true and unafraid of or yet in wise old if youve a ready where those of wit and will always find their or perhaps in slytherin youll make your real those cunning folk use any means to achieve their so put me dont be and dont get in a youre in safe hands i have for im a thinking the whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its it bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still weve just got to try on the ron whispered to kill he was going on about wrestling a smiled trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone the hat seemed to be asking rather harry didnt feel brave or quick witted or any of it at the if only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit that would have been the one for professor mcgonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of i call your you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be she a pink faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of put on the which fell right down over her and sat a moments pause shouted the the table on the right cheered and clapped as hannah went to sit down at the hufflepuff harry saw the ghost of the fat friar waving merrily at shouted the hat and susan scuttled off to sit next to the table second from the left clapped this several ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with terry as he joined went to ravenclaw but became the first new and the table on the far left exploded with harry could see rons twin brothers then became a perhaps it was harrys after all hed heard about but he thought they looked like an unpleasant he was starting to feel definitely sick he remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old he had always been last to be not because he was no but because no one wanted dudley to think they liked harry the hat shouted out the house at but at others it took a little while to the sandy haired boy next to harry in the sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her shouted the ron a horrible thought struck as horrible thoughts always do when youre very what if he wasnt chosen at what if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for until professor mcgonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and hed better get back on the when neville the boy who kept losing his was he fell over on his way to the the hat took a long time to decide with when it finally neville ran off still wearing and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at the hat had barely touched his head when it malfoy went to join his friends crabbe and looking pleased with there werent many people left then a pair of twin and then sally and at last as harry stepped whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the did she the harry the last thing harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at next second he was looking at the black inside of the he said a small voice in his very plenty of i not a bad mind theres a my yes and a nice thirst to prove now thats so where shall i put harry gripped the edges of the stool and not not said the small you you could be you its all here in your and slytherin will help you on the way to no doubt about that if youre sure better be harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole he took off the hat and walked shakily toward the gryffindor he was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer percy the prefect got up and shook his hand while the weasley twins got we got harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff hed seen the ghost patted his giving harry the horrible feeling hed just plunged it into a bucket of ice cold he could see the high table properly at the end nearest him sat who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs harry grinned and in the center of the high in a large gold sat albus harry recognized him at once from the card hed gotten out of the chocolate frog on the dumbledores silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the harry spotted professor the nervous young man from the leaky he was looking very peculiar in a large purple and now there were only three people left to be a black boy even taller than joined harry at the gryffindor became a ravenclaw and then it was rons he was pale green by harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had harry clapped loudly with the rest as ron collapsed into the chair next to said percy weasley pompously across harry as was made a professor mcgonagall rolled up her scroll and took the sorting hat harry looked down at his empty gold he had only just realized how hungry he the pumpkin pasties seemed ages albus dumbledore had gotten to his he was beaming at the his arms opened as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all he to a new year at before we begin our i would like to say a few and here they he sat back everybody clapped and harry didnt know whether to laugh or he a bit he asked percy said percy a best wizard in the but he is a bit harrys mouth fell the dishes in front of him were now piled with he had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one roast roast pork chops and lamb bacon and boiled roast yorkshire for some strange peppermint the dursleys had never exactly starved but hed never been allowed to eat as much as he dudley had always taken anything that harry really even if it made him harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to it was all does look said the ghost in the ruff watching harry cut up his you i havent eaten for nearly four hundred said the dont need of but one does miss i dont think ive in troduced sir nicholas de mimsy porpington at your resident ghost of gryffindor know who you said ron brothers told me about you youre nearly headless would prefer you to call me sir nicholas de mimsy the ghost began but sandy haired seamus finnigan how can you be nearly sir nicholas looked extremely as if their little chat wasnt going at all the way he he said he seized his left ear and his whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a someone had obviously tried to behead but not done it looking pleased at the stunned looks on their nearly headless nick flipped his head back onto his and new i hope youre going to help us win the house championship this gryffindors have never gone so long without slytherins have got the cup six years in a the bloody barons becoming almost unbearable hes the slytherin harry looked over at the slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting with blank staring a gaunt and robes stained with silver he was right next to malfoy harry was pleased to didnt look too pleased with the seating did he get covered in asked seamus with great never said nearly headless nick when everyone had eaten as much as they the remains of the food faded from the leaving them sparkling clean as a moment later the desserts blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think apple treacle chocolate eclairs and jam jell rice pudding as harry helped himself to a treacle the talk turned to their half and said dads a mom didnt tell him she was a witch til after they were bit of a nasty shock for the others about said my gran brought me up and shes a said the family thought i was all muggle for my great uncle algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me he pushed me off the end of blackpool pier i nearly drowned but nothing happened until i was great uncle algie came round for and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my great auntie enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let but i bounced all the way down the garden and into the they were all really gran was she was so and you should have seen their faces when i got in here they thought i might not be magic enough to you great uncle algie was so pleased he bought me my on harrys other percy weasley and hermione were talking about lessons do hope they start right theres so much to im particularly interested in you turning something into something of its supposed to be very difficult be starting just matches into needles and that sort of thing who was starting to feel warm and looked up at the high table hagrid was drinking deeply from his professor mcgonagall was talking to professor professor in his absurd was talking to a teacher with greasy black a hooked and sallow it happened very the hook nosed teacher looked past quirrells turban straight into harrys eyes and a hot pain shot across the scar on harrys harry clapped a hand to his is asked the pain had gone as quickly as it had harder to shake off was the feeling harry had gotten from the teachers look a feeling that he didnt like harry at that teacher talking to professor he asked you know quirrell do no wonder hes looking so thats professor he teaches but he doesnt want to everyone knows hes after quirrells knows an awful lot about the dark harry watched snape for a but snape didnt look at him at the desserts too and professor dumbledore got to his feet the hall fell just a few more words now that we are all fed and i have a few start of term notices to give years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all and a few of our older students would do well to remember that as dumbledores twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the weasley have also been asked by the to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the trials will be held in the second week of the anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact madam i must tell you that this the third floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful harry but he was one of the few who not he muttered to said frowning at because he usually gives us a reason why were not allowed to go somewhere the forests full of dangerous everyone knows i do think he might have told us at before we go to let us sing the school cried harry noticed that the other teachers smiles had become rather dumbledore gave his wand a little as if he was trying to get a fly off the and a long golden ribbon flew out of which rose high above the tables and twisted into pick their favorite said off we and the school hoggy warty teach us something whether we be old and bald or young with scabby our heads could do with filling with some interesting for now theyre bare and full of dead flies and bits of so teach us things worth bring back what weve just do your well do the and learn until our brains all everybody finished the song at different at only the weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had he was one of those who clapped he wiping his magic beyond all we do and off you the gryffindor first years followed percy through the chattering out of the great and up the marble harrys legs were like lead but only because he was so tired and full of he was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they or that twice percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging they climbed more yawning and dragging their and harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden a bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of and as percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at percy whispered to the first he raised his show a rude like the air being let out of a you want me to go to the bloody there was a and a little man with dark eyes and a wide mouth floating cross legged in the clutching the walking he with an evil what he swooped suddenly at they all or the baronll hear about i mean barked peeves stuck out his tongue and dropping the walking sticks on nevilles they heard him rattling coats of armor as he want to watch out for said as they set off bloody barons the only one who can control he wont even listen to us here we at the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk she said and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the they all scrambled through it neville needed a leg up and found themselves in the gryffindor common a round room full of squashy percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through at the top of a spiral staircase they were obviously in one of the towers they found their beds at five four posters hung with deep velvet their trunks had already been brought too tired to talk they pulled on their pajamas and fell into great isnt ron muttered to harry through the hes chewing my harry was going to ask ron if hed had any of the treacle but he fell asleep almost at perhaps harry had eaten a bit too because he had a very strange he was wearing professor quirrells which kept talking to telling him he must transfer to slytherin at because it was his harry told the turban he didnt want to be in it got heavier and he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully and there was laughing at him as he struggled with it then malfoy turned into the hook nosed whose laugh became high and cold there was a burst of green light and harry sweating and he rolled over and fell asleep and when he woke next he didnt remember the dream at chapter eight the potions master to the tall kid with the red the you see his you see his whispers followed harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next people lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at or doubled back to pass him in the corridors harry wished they because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to there were a hundred and forty two staircases at sweeping rickety some that led somewhere different on a some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to then there were doors that wouldnt open unless you asked or tickled them in exactly the right and doors that werent really doors at but solid walls just it was also very hard to remember where anything because it all seemed to move around a the people in the portraits kept going to visit each and harry was sure the coats of armor could the ghosts didnt it was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to nearly headless nick was always happy to point new gryffindors in the right but peeves the poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for he would drop wastepaper baskets on your pull rugs from under your pelt you with bits of or sneak up behind grab your and your even worse than if that was was the argus harry and ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out of bounds corridor on the third he wouldnt believe they were was sure they were trying to break into it on and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by professor who was filch owned a cat called a dust colored creature with lamp like eyes just like she patrolled the corridors break a rule in front of put just one toe out of and shed whisk off for whod two seconds filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone perhaps the weasley and could pop up as suddenly as any of the the students all hated and it was the dearest ambition of many to give norris a good and once you had managed to find there were the classes there was a lot more to as harry quickly found than waving your wand and saying a few funny they had to study the night skies through their telescopes every wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study with a dumpy little witch called professor where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and and found out what they were used easily the most boring class was history of which was the only one taught by a professor binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to leaving his body behind binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and and got emetic the evil and uric the oddball mixed professor the charms was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his at the start of their first class he took the roll and when he reached harrys name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of professor mcgonagall was again harry had been quite right to think she wasnt a teacher to strict and she gave them a talking to the moment they sat down in her first is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at she messing around in my class will leave and not come you have been then she changed her desk into a pig and back they were all very impressed and couldnt wait to get but soon realized they werent going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long after taking a lot of complicated they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a by the end of the only hermione granger had made any difference to her professor mcgonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave hermione a rare the class everyone had really been looking forward to was defense against the dark but quirrells lessons turned out to be a bit of a his classroom smelled strongly of which everyone said was to ward off a vampire hed met in romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these his he told had been given to him by an african prince as a thank you for getting rid of a troublesome but they werent sure they believed this for one when seamus finnigan asked eagerly to hear how quirrell had fought off the quirrell went pink and started talking about the for they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the and the weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as so that quirrell was protected wherever he harry was very relieved to find out that he wasnt miles behind everyone lots of people had come from muggle families like hadnt had any idea that they were witches and there was so much to learn that even people like ron didnt have much of a head friday was an important day for harry and they finally managed to find their way down to the great hall for breakfast without getting lost have we got harry asked ron as he poured sugar on his potions with the said head of slytherin they say he always favors them well be able to see if its mcgonagall favored said professor mcgonagall was head of gryffindor but it hadnt stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day just the mail harry had gotten used to this by but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the great hall during circling the tables until they saw their and dropping letters and packages onto their hedwig hadnt brought harry anything so she sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school this she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto harrys harry tore it open at it in a very untidy dear i know you get friday afternoons so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around i want to hear all about your first send us an answer back with hagrid harry borrowed rons scribbled see you later on the back of the and sent hedwig off it was lucky that harry had tea with hagrid to look forward because the potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so at the start of term harry had gotten the idea that professor snape disliked by the end of the first potions he knew hed been snape didnt dislike harry he hated potions lessons took place down in one of the it was colder here than up in the main and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the like started the class by taking the roll and like he paused at harrys he said our new draco malfoy and his friends crabbe and goyle sniggered behind their snape finished calling the names and looked up at the his eyes were black like but they had none of hagrids they were cold and empty and made you think of dark are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of he he spoke in barely more than a but they caught every word like professor snape had y caught every word like professor snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without there is little foolish wand waving many of you will hardly believe this is i dont expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering the delicate power of liquids that creep through human bewitching the ensnaring the i can teach you how to bottle brew even stopper death if you arent as big a bunch of dunderheads as i usually have to more silence followed this little harry and ron exchanged looks with raised hermione granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasnt a said snape would i get if i added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of powdered root of what to an infusion of harry glanced at who looked as stumped as he hermiones hand had shot into the dont said snapes lips curled into a tut fame clearly isnt he ignored hermiones try where would you look if i told you to find me a hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her but harry didnt have the faintest idea what a bezoar he tried not to look at and who were shaking with dont you wouldnt open a book before harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold he had looked through his books at the but did snape expect him to remember everything in one thousand magical herbs and snape was still ignoring hermiones quivering is the between monkshood and at hermione stood her hand stretching toward the dungeon dont said harry think hermione why dont you try a few people harry caught seamuss and seamus was not he snapped at your asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the draught of living a bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most as for monkshood and they are the same which also goes by the name of why arent you all copying that there was a sudden rummaging for quills and over the snape a point will be taken from gryffindor house for your things didnt improve for the gryffindors as the potions lesson snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure he swept around in his long black watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake criticizing almost everyone except whom he seemed to he was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the neville had somehow managed to melt seamuss cauldron into a twisted and their potion was seeping across the stone burning holes in peoples within the whole class was standing on their stools while who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and snarled clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his him up to the hospital snape spat at then he rounded on harry and who had been working next to potter why didnt you tell him not to add the thought hed make you look good if he got it did thats another point youve lost for this was so unfair that harry opened his mouth to but ron kicked him behind their push he heard snape can turn very as they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour harrys mind was racing and his spirits were hed lost two points for gryffindor in his very first week why did snape hate him so said always taking points off fred and can i come and meet hagrid with at five to three they left the castle and made their way across the hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden a crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front when harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming then hagrids voice rang fang hagrids hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door he he let them struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black there was only one room hams and pheasants were hanging from the a copper kettle was boiling on the open and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over yerselves at said letting go of who bounded straight at ron and started licking his like fang was clearly not as fierce as he is harry told who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a said glancing at rons i spent half me life chasin yer twin brothers away from the the rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their but harry and ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told hagrid all about their first fang rested his head on harrys knee and drooled all over his harry and ron were delighted to hear hagrid call fitch old as fer that id like ter introduce her to fang dyeh every time i go up ter the she follows me cant get rid of her fitch puts her up to harry told hagrid about snapes like told harry not to worry about that snape liked hardly any of the he seemed to really hate said should yet harry couldnt help thinking that hagrid didnt quite meet his eyes when he said yer brother hagrid asked liked him a lot great with harry wondered if hagrid had changed the subject on while ron told hagrid all about charlies work with harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea it was a cutting from the daily gringotts break in latest investigations continue into the break in at gringotts on widely believed to be the work of dark wizards or witches gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same were not telling you what was in so keep your noses out if you know whats good for said a gringotts spokesgoblin this harry remembered ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob but ron hadnt mentioned the said gringotts break in happened on my it mightve been happening while we were there was no doubt about hagrid definitely didnt meet harrys eyes this he grunted and offered him another rock harry read the story the vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and if you could call it taking out that grubby little had that been what the thieves were looking as harry and ron walked back to the castle for their pockets weighed down with rock cakes theyd been too polite to harry thought that none of the lessons hed had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with had hagrid collected that package just in where was it and did hagrid know something about snape that he didnt want to tell chapter nine the midnight duel harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than but that was before he met draco first year gryffindors only had potions with the so they didnt have to put up with malfoy or at they didnt until they spotted a notice pinned up in the gryffindor common room that made them all flying lessons would be starting on thursday and gryffindor and slytherin would be learning said harry what i always to make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of he had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything dont know that youll make a fool of said ron i know malfoys always going on about how good he is at but i bet thats all malfay certainly did talk about flying a he complained loudly about first years never getting on the house quidditch teams and told boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping muggles in he wasnt the only the way seamus finnigan told hed spent most of his childhood around the countryside on his even ron would tell anyone whod listen about the time hed almost hit a hang glider on charlies old everyone from wizarding families talked about quidditch ron had already had a big argument with dean who shared their about ron couldnt see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to harry had caught ron prodding deans poster of west ham soccer trying to make the players neville had never been on a broomstick in his because his grandmother had never let him near harry felt shed had good because neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the hermione granger was almost as nervous about flying as neville this was something you couldnt learn by heart out of a book not that she hadnt at breakfast on thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips shed gotten out of a library book called quidditch through the neville was hanging on to her every desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick but everybody else was very pleased when hermiones lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the harry hadnt had a single letter since hagrids something that malfoy had been quick to of malfoys eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from which he opened gloatingly at the slytherin a barn owl brought neville a small package from his he opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large which seemed to be full of white a he knows i forget things this tells you if theres something youve forgotten to you hold it tight like this and if it turns red his face because the remembrall had suddenly glowed forgotten neville was trying to remember what hed forgotten when draco who was passing the gryffindor snatched the remembrall out of his harry and ron jumped to their they were half hoping for a reason to fight but professor who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the was there in a going got my malfoy quickly dropped the remembrall back on the he and he sloped away with crabbe and goyle behind at three thirty that and the other gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying it was a breezy and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden whose trees were swaying darkly in the the slytherins were already and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the harry had heard fred and george weasley complain about the school saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too or always flew slightly to the their madam she had gray and yellow eyes like a what are you all waiting she stand by a come hurry harry glanced down at his it was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd out your right hand over your called madam hooch at the say everyone harrys broom jumped into his hand at but it was one of the few that hermione grangers had simply rolled over on the and nevilles hadnt moved at perhaps like could tell when you were thought there was a quaver in nevilles voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the madam hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the and walked up and down the rows correcting their harry and ron were delighted when she told malfoy hed been doing it wrong for when i blow my you kick off from the said madam your brooms rise a few and then come straight back down by leaning forward on my whistle three two but nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the pushed off hard before the whistle had touched madam hoochs she but neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle twelve feet twenty harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling saw him slip sideways off the broom and wham a thud and a nasty crack and neville lay facedown on the grass in a his broomstick was still rising higher and and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of madam hooch was bending over her face as white as harry heard her boy its all up you she turned to the rest of the of you is to move while i take this boy to the hospital you leave those brooms where they are or youll be out of hogwarts before you can say come his face tear clutching his hobbled off with madam who had her arm around no sooner were they out of earshot than malfoy burst into you see his the great the other slytherins joined snapped parvati sticking up for said pansy a hard faced slytherin thought youd like fat little said darting forward and snatching something out of the that stupid thing longbottoms gran sent the remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it that said harry everyone stopped talking to malfoy smiled think ill leave it somewhere for longbottom to find how about up a it harry but malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken he hadnt been he could fly hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he and get harry grabbed his shouted hermione hooch told us not to move youll get us all into harry ignored blood was pounding in his he mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up he air rushed through his and his robes whipped out behind him and in a rush of fierce joy he realized hed found something he could do without being taught this was this was he pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from he turned his broomstick sharply to face malfoy in malfoy looked it harry ill knock you off that said trying to but looking harry what to he leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both and it shot toward malfay like a malfoy only just got out of the way in harry made a sharp about face and held the broom a few people below were crabbe and goyle up here to save your harry the same thought seemed to have struck it if you he and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the harry as though in slow the ball rise up in the air and then start to he leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down next second he was gathering speed in a steep racing the ball wind whistled in his mingled with the screams of people watching he stretched out his hand a foot from the ground he caught just in time to pull his broom and he toppled gently onto the grass with the remembrall clutched safely in his his heart sank faster than hed just professor mcgonagall was running toward he got to his in all my time at hogwarts professor mcgonagall was almost speechless with and her glasses flashed how dare you might have broken your neck wasnt his professor miss patil malfoy follow harry caught sight of and goyles triumphant faces as he walking numbly in professor mcgonagalls wake as she strode toward the he was going to be he just knew he wanted to say something to defend but there seemed to be something wrong with his professor mcgonagall was sweeping along without even looking at he had to jog to keep now hed done he hadnt even lasted two hed be packing his bags in ten what would the dursleys say when he turned up on the up the front up the marble staircase and still professor mcgonagall didnt say a word to she wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with harry trotting miserably behind maybe she was taking him to he thought of expelled but allowed to stay on as perhaps he could be hagrids his stomach twisted as he imagined watching ron and the others becoming while he stumped around the grounds carrying hagrids professor mcgonagall stopped outside a she opened the door and poked her head professor could i borrow wood for a thought was wood a cane she was going to use on but wood turned out to be a a burly fifth year boy who came out of flitwicles class looking you said professor and they marched on up the wood looking curiously at professor mcgonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for who was busy writing rude words on the she peeves threw the chalk into a which clanged and he swooped out professor mcgonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two this is oliver wood ive found you a woods expression changed from puzzlement to you said professor mcgonagall boys a ive never seen anything like was that your first time on a harry nodded he didnt have a clue what was going but he didnt seem to be being and some of the feeling started coming back to his caught that thing in his hand after a fifty foot professor mcgonagall told even scratch charlie weasley couldnt have done wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at seen a game of he asked captain of the gryffindor professor mcgonagall just the build for a said now walking around harry and staring at speedy well have to get him a decent professor a nimbus two thousand or a cleansweep id i shall speak to professor dumbledore and see if we cant bend the first year heaven we need a better team than last flattened in that last match by i couldnt look severus snape in the face for professor mcgonagall peered sternly over her glasses at want to hear youre training or i may change my mind about punishing then she suddenly father would have been she was an excellent quidditch player it was harry had just finished telling ron what had happened when hed left the grounds with professor ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his but hed forgotten all about he first years never you must be the youngest house player in about a said shoveling pie into his he felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the told ron was so so he just sat and gaped at start training next said dont tell wood wants to keep it a fred and george weasley now came into the spotted and hurried said george in a low told were on the team too tell were going to win that quidditch cup for sure this said havent won since charlie but this years team is going to be you must be wood was almost skipping when he told weve got to lee jordan reckons hes found a new secret passageway out of the its that one behind the statue of gregory the smarmy that we found in our first see fred and george had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned flanked by crabbe and a last when are you getting the train back to the a lot braver now that youre back on the ground and youve got your little friends with said harry there was of course nothing at all little about crabbe and but as the high table was full of neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and take you on anytime on my said if you wizards wands only no whats the never heard of a wizards duel i course he said wheeling his whos malfoy looked at crabbe and sizing them he all well meet you in the trophy thats always when malfoy had ron and harry looked at each is a wizards said what do you youre my a seconds there to take over if you said ron getting started at last on his cold catching the look on harrys he added people only die in proper you with real the most you and malfoyll be able to do is send sparks at each neither of you knows enough magic to do any real i bet he expected you to what if i wave my wand and nothing it away and punch him on the ron they both looked it was hermione a person eat in peace in this said hermione ignored him and spoke to couldnt help overhearing what you and malfoy were saying you ron and you mustnt go wandering around the school at think of the points youll lose gryffindor if youre and youre bound to its really very selfish of its really none of your said said all the it wasnt what youd call the perfect end to the harry as he lay awake much later listening to dean and seamus falling asleep wasnt back from the hospital ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as he tries to curse youd better dodge because i cant remember how to block there was a very good chance they were going to get caught by filch or and harry felt he was pushing his breaking another school rule on the other malfoys sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness this was his big chance to beat malfoy face to he couldnt miss past ron muttered at better they pulled on their picked up their and crept across the tower down the spiral and into the gryffindor common a few embers were still glowing in the turning all the armchairs into hunched black they had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest cant believe youre going to do a lamp flickered it was hermione wearing a pink bathrobe and a said ron back to almost told your hermione hes a hed put a stop to harry couldnt believe anyone could be so he said to he pushed open the portrait of the fat lady and climbed through the hermione wasnt going to give up that she followed ron through the portrait hissing at them like an angry you care about do you only care about i dont want slytherin to win the house and youll lose all the points i got from professor mcgonagall for knowing about switching but i warned you just remember what i said when youre on the train home youre so but what they they didnt find hermione had turned to the portrait of the fat lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty the fat lady had gone on a nighttime visit and hermione was locked out of gryffindor what am i going to she asked your said got to we re going to be they hadnt even reached the end of the corridor when hermione caught up with coming with she are think im going to stand out here and wait for filch to catch if he finds all three of us ill tell him the that i was trying to stop and you can back me got some nerve said ron both of said harry i heard it was a sort of breathed squinting through the it wasnt it was he was curled up on the fast but jerked suddenly awake as they crept goodness you found ive been out here for i couldnt remember the new password to get in to your voice the passwords pig snout but it wont help you the fat ladys gone off your said said showing pomfrey mended it in about a weve got to be well see you later leave said scrambling to his dont want to stay here the bloody barons been past twice ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at hermione and either of you get us ill never rest until ive learned that curse of the bogies quirrell told us and used it on hermione opened her perhaps to tell ron exactly how to use the curse of the but harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all they flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high at every turn harry expected to run into filch or but they were they sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy malfoy and crabbe werent there the crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught and statues winked silver and gold in the they edged along the keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the harry took out his wand in case malfoy leapt in and started at the minutes crept maybe hes chickened ron then a noise in the next room made them harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak and it wasnt my they might be lurking in a it was filch speaking to horror harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as they scurried silently toward the away from filchs nevilles robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard filch enter the trophy in here they heard him harry mouthed to the others they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of they could hear filch getting neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he grabbed ron around the and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of the clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole harry and the four of them sprinted down the not looking back to see whether filch was following they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then harry in the without any idea where they were or where they were going they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden hurtled along it and came out near their charms which they knew was miles from the trophy think weve lost harry leaning against the cold wall and wiping his neville was bent wheezing and i told hermione clutching at the stitch in her told got to get back to gryffindor said as tricked hermione said to realize dont he was never going to meet you filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy malfoy must have tipped him harry thought she was probably but he wasnt going to tell her it wasnt going to be that they hadnt gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of it was he caught sight of them and gave a squeal of peeves please youll get us thrown peeves around at ickle youll get if you dont give us tell i said peeves in a saintly but his eyes glittered for your own you out of the snapped taking a swipe at peeves this was a big out of peeves out of bed down the charms ducking under they ran for their right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door and it was is ron as they pushed helplessly at the done this is the they could hear filch running as fast as he could toward peevess move hermione she grabbed harrys tapped the and the lock clicked and the door swung open they piled through shut it and pressed their ears against way did they filch was tell mess with now where did they say nothing if you dont say said peeves in his annoying singsong right ha told you i wouldnt say nothing if you didnt say ha and they heard the sound of peeves whooshing away and filch cursing in thinks this door is harry think well be okay get for neville had been tugging on the sleeve of harrys bathrobe for the last harry turned around and quite for a he was sure hed walked into a nightmare this was too on top of everything that had happened so they werent in a as he had they were in a the forbidden corridor on the third and now they knew why it was they were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and it had three three pairs of mad three twitching and quivering in their three drooling saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish it was standing quite all six eyes staring at and harry knew that the only reason they werent already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by but it was quickly getting over there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls harry groped for the doorknob between filch and hed take they fell backward harry slammed the door and they they almost back down the filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere because they didnt see him but they hardly cared all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that they didnt stop running until they reached the portrait of the fat lady on the seventh on earth have you all she looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their sweaty mind that pig pig panted and the portrait swung they scrambled into the common room and into it was a while before any of them said looked as if hed never speak do they think theyre keeping a thing like that locked up in a said ron any dog needs that one hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back dont use your any of do she you see what it was standing harry wasnt looking at its i was too busy with its not the it was standing on a its obviously guarding she stood glaring at i hope youre pleased with we could all have been killed or if you dont im going to ron stared after his mouth we dont he think we dragged her wouldnt but hermione had given harry something else to think about as he climbed back into the dog was guarding what had hagrid gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide except perhaps it looked as though harry had found out where the grubby littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen chapter ten halloween malfoy couldnt believe his eyes when he saw that harry and ron were still at hogwarts the next looking tired but perfectly by the next morning harry and ron thought that meeting the three headed dog had been an excellent and they were quite keen to have another in the harry filled ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from gringotts to and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy either really valuable or really said said but as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches they didnt have much chance of guessing what it was without further neither neville nor hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the all neville cared about was never going near the dog hermione was now refusing to speak to harry and but she was such a bossy know it all that they saw this as an added all they really wanted now was a way of getting back at and to their great just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week as the owls flooded into the great hall as everyones attention was caught at once by a thin package carried by six large screech harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of knocking his bacon to the they had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the harry ripped open the letter which was because it do not open the parcel at the it contains your new nimbus two but i dont want everybody knowing youve got a broomstick or theyll all want oliver wood will meet you tonight on the quidditch field at seven oclock for your first training professor mcgonagall harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to ron to nimbus two ron moaned never even touched they left the hall wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by crabbe and malfoy seized the package from harry and felt a he throwing it back to harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his be in for it this first years arent allowed ron couldnt resist not any old he a nimbus two what did you say youve got at a comet two ron grinned at look but theyre not in the same league as the would you know about you couldnt afford half the malfoy snapped suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by before ron could professor flitwick appeared at malfoys i he been sent a said malfoy thats said professor beaming at mcgonagall told me all about the special and what model is nimbus two said fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on malfoys its really thanks to malfoy here that ive got he harry and ron headed smothering their laughter at malfoys obvious rage and its harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble he hadnt stolen nevilles remembrall i woulnt be on the i suppose you think thats a reward for breaking came an angry voice from just behind hermione was stomping up the looking disapprovingly at the package in harrys thought you werent speaking to said dont stop said doing us so much hermione marched away with her nose in the harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that it kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his or straying off to the quidditch field where hed be learning to play that he bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was and then rushed upstairs with ron to unwrap the nimbus two thousand at ron as the broomstick rolled onto harrys even who knew nothing about the different thought it looked sleek and with a mahogany it had a long tail of straight twigs and nimbus two thousand written in gold near the as seven oclock drew harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the quidditch held never been inside the stadium hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going at either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the they reminded harry of the little plastic sticks muggle children blew bubbles except that they were fifty feet too eager to fly again to wait for harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the what a feeling he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the the nimbus two thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest come oliver wood had fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his harry landed next to said his eyes see what mcgonagall you really are a im just going to teach you the rules this then youll be joining team practice three times a he opened the inside were four different sized said quidditch is easy enough to even if its not too easy to there are seven players on each three of them are called harry as wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer balls called the said chasers throw the quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a ten points every time the quaffle goes through one of the follow chasers throw the quaffle and put it through the hoops to harry thats sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six isnt said wood said harry theres another player on each side whos called the keeper im keeper for i have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from one said who was determined to remember it they play with the got so what are they he pointed at the three balls left inside the show you said he handed harry a small a bit like a short baseball going to show you what the bludgers wood two are the he showed harry two identical jet black and slightly smaller than the red harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the wood warned he bent down and freed one of the at the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at harrys harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his and sent it away into the air it around their heads and then shot at who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the wood forcing the struggling bludger back into the crate and strapping it down bludgers rocket trying to knock players off their thats why you have two beaters on each team the weasley twins are ours its their job to protect their side from the bludgers and try and knock them toward the other so think youve got all chasers try and score with the the keeper guards the goal the beaters keep the bludgers away from their harry reeled said have the bludgers ever killed harry hoping he sounded at weve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than the last member of the team is the thats and you dont have to worry about the quaffle or the bludgers unless they crack my head the weasleys are more than a match for the bludgers i theyre like a pair of human bludgers wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last compared with the quaffle and the it was about the size of a large it was bright gold and had little fluttering silver said the golden and its the most important ball of the its very hard to catch because its so fast and difficult to its the seekers job to catch youve got to weave in and out of the and quaffle to get it before the other teams because whichever seeker catches the snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty so they nearly always thats why seekers get fouled so a game of quidditch only ends when the snitch is so it can go on for ages i think the record is three they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some thats it any harry shook his he understood what he had to do all it was doing it that was going to be the wont practice with the snitch said carefully shutting it back inside the too we might lose lets try you out with a few of he pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes he and harry were up in the wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for harry to harry didnt miss a single and wood was after half an night had really fallen and they couldnt carry quidditch cupll have our name on it this said wood happily as they trudged back up to the wouldnt be surprised if you turn out better than charlie and he could have played for england if he hadnt gone off chasing perhaps it was because he was now so what with quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his but harry could hardly believe it when he realized that hed already been at hogwarts two the castle felt more like home than privet drive ever his were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the on halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the even professor flitwick announced in charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects something they had all been dying to try since theyd seen him make nevilles toad around the professor flitwick put the class into pairs to harrys partner was seamus finnigan was a because neville had been trying to catch his was to be working with hermione it was hard to tell whether ron or hermione was angrier about she hadnt spoken to either of them since the day harrys broomstick had dont forget that nice wrist movement weve been squeaked professor perched on top of his pile of books as and swish and and saying the magic words properly is very too never forget wizard who said s instead of f and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his it was very harry and seamus swished and but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it harry had to put it out with his at the next wasnt having much more he waving his long arms like a saying it harry heard hermione wing gar dium levi o make the gar nice and do if youre so ron hermione rolled up the sleeves of her flicked her and their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their well cried professor see miss grangers done ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the no wonder no one can stand he said to harry as they pushed their way into the crowded a someone knocked into harry as they hurried past it was harry caught a glimpse of her face and was startled to see that she was in think she heard said but he looked a bit mustve noticed shes got no hermione didnt turn up for the next class and wasnt seen all on their way down to the great hall for the halloween harry and ron overheard parvati patil telling her friend lavender that hermione was crying in the girls bathroom and wanted to be left ron looked still more awkward at but a moment later they had entered the great where the halloween decorations put hermione out of their a thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black making the candles in the pumpkins the feast appeared suddenly on the golden as it had at the start of term harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when professor quirrell came sprinting into the his turban askew and terror on his everyone stared as he reached professor dumbledores slumped against the and in the dungeons thought you ought to he then sank to the floor in a dead there was an it took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of professor dumbledores wand to bring he your houses back to the dormitories percy was in his stick first no need to fear the troll if you follow my stay close behind make first years coming excuse im a could a troll get harry asked as they climbed the ask theyre supposed to be really said peeves let it in for a halloween they passed different groups of people hurrying in different as they jostled their way through a crowd of confused harry suddenly grabbed rons just thought about doesnt know about the ron bit his all he percyd better not see ducking they joined the hufflepuffs going the other slipped down a deserted side and hurried off toward the girls they had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind hissed pulling harry behind a large stone peering around they saw not percy but he crossed the corridor and disappeared from he harry isnt he down in the dungeons with the rest of the quietly as they crept along the next corridor after snapes fading heading for the third harry but ron held up his you smell harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to and then they heard it a low and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic ron pointed at the end of a passage to the something huge was moving toward they shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of it was a horrible twelve feet its skin was a granite its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a it had short legs thick as tree trunks with horny the smell coming from it was it was holding a huge wooden which dragged along the floor because its arms were so the troll stopped next to a doorway and peered it waggled its long making up its tiny then slouched slowly into the keys in the harry could lock it said ron they edged toward the open mouths praying the troll wasnt about to come out of with one great harry managed to grab the slam the and lock flushed with their they started to run back up the but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop a petrified scream and it was coming from the chamber theyd just chained said pale as the bloody the girls harry they said it was the last thing they wanted to but what choice did they wheeling they sprinted back to the door and turned the fumbling in their harry pulled the door open and they ran hermione granger was shrinking against the wall looking as if she was about to the troll was advancing on knocking the sinks off the walls as it harry said desperately to seizing a he threw it as hard as he could against the the troll stopped a few feet from it lumbered blinking to see what had made the its mean little eyes saw it then made for him lifting its club as it pea yelled ron from the other side of the and he threw a metal pipe at the troll didnt even seem to notice the pipe hitting its but it heard the yell and paused turning its ugly snout toward ron giving harry time to run around harry yelled at trying to pull her toward the but she couldnt she was still flat against the her mouth open with the shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll it roared again and started toward who was nearest and had no way to harry then did something that was both very brave and very he took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the trolls neck from the troll couldnt feel harry hanging but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its and harrys wand had still been in his hand when hed jumped it had gone straight up one of the trolls howling with the troll twisted and flailed its with harry clinging on for dear any the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the hermione had sunk to the floor in ron pulled out his own wand not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his the club flew suddenly out of the trolls rose high up into the turned slowly over and with a sickening onto its owners the troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its with a thud that made the whole room harry got to his he was shaking and out of ron was standing there with his wand still staring at what he had it was hermione who spoke it i dont think said i think its just been knocked he bent down and pulled his wand out of the trolls it was covered in what looked like lumpy gray troll he wiped it on the trolls a sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look they hadnt realized what a racket they had been but of someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the trolls a moment professor mcgonagall had come bursting into the closely followed by with quirrell bringing up the quirrell took one look at the let out a faint and sat quickly down on a clutching his snape bent over the professor mcgonagall was looking at ron and harry had never seen her look so her lips were hopes of winning fifty points for gryffindor faded quickly from harrys on earth were you thinking said professor with cold fury in her harry looked at who was still standing with his wand in the lucky you werent why arent you in your snape gave harry a piercing harry looked at the he wished ron would put his wand then a small voice came out of the professor mcgonagall they were looking for hermione had managed to get to her feet at i went looking for the troll because i i thought i could deal with it on my own you because ive read all about ron dropped his hermione telling a downright lie to a they hadnt found id be dead harry stuck his wand up its nose and ron knocked it out with its own they didnt have time to come and fetch it was about to finish me off when they harry and ron tried to look as though this story wasnt new to in that said professor staring at the three of you foolish how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your hermione hung her harry was hermione was the last person to do anything against the and here she pretending she to get them out of it was as if snape had started handing out five points will be taken from gryffindor for said professor very disappointed in if youre not hurt at youd better get off to gryffindor students are finishing the feast in their hermione professor mcgonagall turned to harry and i still say you were but not many first years could have taken on a full grown mountain you each win gryffindor five professor dumbledore will be informed of you may they hurried out of the chamber and didnt speak at all until they had climbed two floors it was a relief to be away from the smell of the quite apart from anything should have gotten more than ten ron you once shes taken off of her to get us out of trouble like ron we did save might not have needed saving if we hadnt locked the thing in with harry reminded they had reached the portrait of the fat they said and the common room was packed and everyone was eating the food that had been sent stood alone by the waiting for there was a very embarrassed none of them looking at each they all said and hurried off to get but from that moment hermione granger became their there are some things you cant share without ending up liking each and knocking out a twelve foot mountain troll is one of chapter eleven quidditch as they entered the weather turned very the mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled every morning the ground was covered in hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the quidditch bundled up in a long moleskin rabbit fur and enormous beaverskin the quidditch season had on harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of gryffindor versus if gryffindor they would move up into second place in the house hardly anyone had seen harry play because wood had decided as their secret harry should be but the news that he was playing seeker had leaked out and harry didnt know which was worse people telling him hed be brilliant or people telling him theyd be running around underneath him holding a it was really lucky that harry now had hermlone as a he didnt know how hed have gotten through all his homework without what with all the last minute quidditch practice wood was making them she had also tent him quidditch through the which turned out to be a very interesting harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a world cup match in that seekers were usually the smallest and fastest and that most serious quidditch accidents seemed to happen to that although people rarely died playing referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the sahara hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since harry and ron had saved her from the mountain and she was much nicer for the day before harrys first quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam they were standing with their backs to getting when snape crossed the harry noticed at once that snape was and hermione moved closer together to block the fire from they were sure it wouldnt be something about their guilty faces caught snapes he limped he hadnt seen the but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off that youve got it was quidditch through the harry showed books are not to be taken outside the said it to five points from just made that rule harry muttered angrily as snape limped whats wrong with his but i hope its really hurting said ron the gryffindor common room was very noisy that and hermione sat together next to a hermione was checking harry and rons charms homework for she would never let them copy will you but by asking her to read it they got the right answers harry felt he wanted quidditch through the ages to take his mind off his nerves about why should he be afraid of getting he told ron and hermione he was going to ask snape if he could have you than they said but harry had an idea that snape wouldnt refuse if there were other teachers he made his way down to the staffroom and there was no he knocked perhaps snape had left the book in it was worth a he pushed the door ajar and peered inside and a horrible scene met his snape and filch were snape was holding his robes above his one of his legs was bloody and filch was handing snape snape was are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at harry tried to shut the door but snapes face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his harry just wondered if i could have my book harry before snape could take any more points from he sprinted back you get ron asked as harry joined the in a low harry told them what hed know what this he finished tried to get past that three headed dog at thats where he was going when we saw him hes after whatever its and id bet my broomstick he let that troll to make a hermiones eyes were he she know hes not very but he wouldnt try and steal something dumbledore was keeping you think all teachers are saints or snapped with i wouldnt put anything past but whats he whats that dog harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same neville was snoring but harry couldnt he tried to empty his mind he needed to he had he had his first quidditch match in a few hours but the expression on snapes face when harry had seen his leg wasnt easy to the next morning dawned very bright and the great hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good quidditch got to eat some dont want a bit of wheedled not harry felt in an hours time hed be walking onto the you need your said seamus are always the ones who get clobbered by the other said watching seamus pile ketchup on his by eleven oclock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the quidditch many students had the seats might be raised high in the but it was still difficult to see what was going on ron and hermione joined and dean the west ham fan up in the top as a surprise for they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets scabbers had it said potter for and who was good at had done a large gryffindor lion then hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different in the locker harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet quidditch robes would be playing in wood cleared his throat for he said chaser angelina wood is big said fred one weve all been waiting said know olivers speech by fred told were on the team last you said is the best team gryffindors had in were going to i know he glared at them

field waiting for the two her broom in her i want a nice fair all of she once they were all gathered around harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the slytherin marcus a sixth harry thought flint looked as if he had some troll blood in out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high flashing potter for president over the his heart he felt your harry clambered onto his nimbus two madam hooch gave a loud blast on her silver fifteen brooms rose high into the they were the quaffle is taken immediately by angelina johnson of gryffindor what an excellent chaser that girl and rather too the weasley twins lee was doing the commentary for the closely watched by professor shes really belting along up a neat pass to alicia a good find of oliver last year only a reserve back to johnson and the slytherins have taken the slytherin captain marcus flint gains the quaffle and off he goes flint flying like an eagle up there hes going to sc stopped by an excellent

and johnson back in possession of the a clear field ahead and off she goes shes really flying dodges a speeding bludger the goal posts are ahead come angelina keeper bletchley dives misses gryffindors gryffindor cheers filled the cold with howls and moans from the up move ron and hermione squeezed together to give hagrid enough space to join watchin from me said patting a large pair of binoculars around his it isnt the same as bein in the no sign of the snitch said hasnt had much to do outta thats said raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was way up above harry was gliding over the squinting about for some sign of the this was part of his and woods game out of the way until you catch sight of the wood had dont want you attacked before you have to when angelina had harry had done a couple of loop the loops to let off his now he was back to staring around for the once he caught sight of a flash of but it was just a reflection from one of the weasleys and once a bludger decided to come pelting his more like a cannonball than but harry dodged it and fred weasley came chasing after right he had time to as he beat the bludger furiously toward marcus in lee jordan was pucey ducks two two and chaser and speeds toward the wait a moment was that the a murmur ran through the crowd as adrian pucey dropped the too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left harry saw in a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of slytherin seeker terence higgs had seen neck and neck they hurtled toward the snitch all the chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to harry was faster than higgs he could see the little round wings darting up ahead he put on an extra spurt of speed a roar of rage echoed from the gryffindors below marcus flint had blocked harry on and harrys broom spun off harry holding on for dear screamed the madam hooch spoke angrily to flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for but in all the of the golden snitch had disappeared from sight down in the dean thomas was him red are you talking said said dean soccer you get shown the red card and youre out of the this isnt ron reminded was on deans oughta change the flint coulda knocked harry outta the lee jordan was finding it difficult not to take after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating growled professor after that open and revolting foul im warning you all flint nearly kills the gryffindor which could happen to im so a penalty to taken by who puts it no and we continue gryffindor still in it was as harry dodged another which went spinning dangerously past his that it his broom gave a frightening for a split he thought he was going to he gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and hed never felt anything like it happened it was as though the broom was trying to buck him but nimbus two thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders harry tried to turn back toward the gryffindor goal posts he had half a mind to ask wood to call time out and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his he couldnt turn he couldnt direct it at it was through the and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated lee was still in possession flint with the quaffle passes spinnet passes bell hit hard in the face by a hope it broke his nose only professor slytherins score a the slytherins were no one seemed to have noticed that harrys broom was behaving it was carrying him slowly away from the jerking and twitching as it what harry thinks hes hagrid he stared through his i didn know id say hed lost control of his but he cant people were pointing up at harry all over the his broom had started to roll over and with him only just managing to hold then the whole crowd harrys broom had given a wild jerk and harry swung off he was now dangling from holding on with only one something happen to it when flint blocked seamus hagrid his voice nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful dark magic no kid could do that to a nimbus two at these hermione seized hagrids but instead of looking up at she started looking frantically at the are you moaned gray knew hermione ron grabbed the snape was in the middle of the stands opposite he had his eyes fixed on harry and was muttering nonstop under his doing something jinxing the said should we it to before ron could say another hermione had ron turned the binoculars back on his broom was vibrating so it was almost impossible for him to hang on much the whole crowd was on its as the weasleys flew up to try and pull harry safely onto one of their but it was no good every time they got near the broom would jump higher they dropped lower and circled beneath obviously hoping to catch him if he marcus flint seized the quaffle and scored five times without anyone ron muttered hermione had fought her way across to the stand where snape and was now racing along the row behind she didnt even stop to say sorry as she knocked professor quirrell headfirst into the row in reaching she crouched pulled out her and whispered a well chosen bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of snapes it took perhaps thirty seconds for snape to realize that he was on a sudden yelp told her she had done her scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her she scrambled back along the row snape would never know what had it was up in the harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his you can ron neville had been sobbing into hagrids jacket for the last five harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick he hit the field on all fours coughed and something gold fell into his got the he waving it above his and the game ended in complete didnt catch he nearly swallowed flint was still howling twenty minutes but it made no difference harry hadnt broken any rules and lee jordan was still happily shouting the results gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to harry heard none of he was being made a cup of strong tea back in hagrids with ron and was ron was and i saw he was cursing your he wouldnt take his eyes off said who hadnt heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the would snape do somethin like and hermione looked at one wondering what to tell harry decided on the found out something about he told tried to get past that three headed dog on it bit we think he was trying to steal whatever its hagrid dropped the do you know about he hes mine bought him off a greek chappie i met in the pub las year i lent him to dumbledore to guard the said harry dont ask me said hagrid top that snapes trying to steal said hagrid a hogwarts hed do nothin of the why did he just try and kill cried the afternoons events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about i know a jinx when i see ive read all about youve got to keep eye and snape wasnt blinking at i saw tellin yer said hagrid don know why harrys broom acted like but snape wouldn try an kill a listen to all three of yeh yer meddlin in things that don concern its you forget that an you forget what its thats between professor dumbledore an nicolas flamel said theres someone called nicolas flamel is hagrid looked furious with chapter twelve the mirror of erised christmas was one morning in mid hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of the lake froze solid and the weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed quirrell bouncing off the back of his the few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by hagrid before they could fly off no one could wait for the holidays to while the gryffindor common room and the great hall had roaring the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the worst of all were professor snapes classes down in the where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot do feel so said draco one potions all those people who have to stay at hogwarts for christmas because theyre not wanted at he was looking over at harry as he crabbe and goyle who was measuring out powdered spine of ignored malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the quidditch disgusted that the slytherins had he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide mouthed tree frog would be replacing harry as seeker then hed realized that nobody found this because they were all so impressed at the way harry had managed to stay on his bucking so jealous and had gone back to taunting harry about having no proper it was true that harry wasnt going back to privet drive for professor mcgonagall had come around the week making a list of students who would be staying for the and harry had signed up at he didnt feel sorry for himself at this would probably be the best christmas hed ever ron and his brothers were because and weasley were going to romania to visit when they left the dungeons at the end of they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that hagrid was behind want any ron sticking his head through the im all you mind moving out of the came malfoys cold drawl from behind you trying to earn some extra hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave i suppose that hut of hagrids must seem like a palace compared to what your familys used ron dived at malfoy just as snape came up the ron let go of the front of malfoys was professor said sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the was insultin his that as it fighting is against hogwarts said snape points from and be grateful it isnt move all of and goyle pushed roughly past the scattering needles everywhere and get said grinding his teeth at malfoys of these ill get him hate them said and cheer its nearly said yeh come with me an see the great looks a so the three of them followed hagrid and his tree off to the great where professor mcgonagall and professor flitwick were busy with the christmas the last tree put it in the far would the hall looked festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the and no less than twelve towering christmas trees stood around the some sparkling with tiny some glittering with hundreds of many days you got left until yer hagrid said that reminds me weve got half an hour before we should be in the youre said tearing his eyes away from professor who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new said following them out of the before the bit arent were not harry told him since you mentioned nicolas flamel weve been trying to find out who he hagrid looked here ive told yeh drop its nothin to you what that dogs just want to know who nicolas flamel thats said youd like to tell us and save us the harry mustve been through hundreds of books already and we cant find him anywhere just give us a hint i know ive read his name sayin said hagrid have to find out for said and they left hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the they had indeed been searching books for flamels name ever since hagrid had let it because how else were they going to find out what snape was trying to the trouble it was very hard to know where to not knowing what flamel might have done to get himself into a he wasnt in great wizards of the twentieth or notable magical names of our he was from important modern magical and a study of recent developments in and of there was the sheer size of the tens of thousands of thousands of hundreds of narrow hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at harry wandered over to the restricted he had been wondering for a while if flamel wasnt somewhere in you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted and he knew hed never get these were the books containing powerful dark magic never taught at and only read by older students studying advanced defense against the dark are you looking said madam pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at better get go on wishing hed been a bit quicker at thinking up some harry left the and hermione had already agreed theyd better not ask madam pince where they could find they were sure shed be able to tell but they couldnt risk snape hearing what they were up harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found but he wasnt very they had been looking for two after but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasnt surprising theyd found what they really needed was a nice long search without madam pince breathing down their five minutes ron and hermione joined shaking their they went off to will keep looking while im wont said send me an owl if you find you could ask your parents if they know who flamel said be safe to ask as theyre both said once the holidays had ron and harry were having too good a time to think much about they had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than so they were able to get the good armchairs by the they sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork english marshmallows and plotting ways of getting malfoy which were fun to talk about even if they wouldnt ron also started teaching harry wizard this was exactly like muggle chess except that the figures were which made it a lot like directing troops in rons set was very old and like everything else he it had once belonged to someone else in his family in this his old chessmen werent a drawback at ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he harry played with chessmen seamus finnigan had lent and they didnt trust him at he wasnt a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at which was send me cant you see his send we can afford to lose on christmas harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the but not expecting any presents at when he woke early in the the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his said ron sleepily as harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his said you look at ive got some did you said turning to his own which was a lot bigger than harry picked up the top it was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was to from inside was a roughly cut wooden hagrid had obviously whittled it harry blew it it sounded a bit like an a very small parcel contained a we received your message and enclose your christmas from uncle vernon and aunt taped to the note was a fifty pence said ron was fascinated by the fifty he nmat a this is can keep said laughing at how pleased ron and my aunt and uncle so who sent think i know who that ones said turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy i told her you didnt expect any presents and he made you a weasley harry had torn open the parcel to find a hand knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade year she makes us a said unwrapping his mines always really nice of said trying the which was very his next present also contained candy a large box of chocolate frogs from this only left one harry picked it up and felt it was very he unwrapped something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming ron heard of he said in a hushed dropping the box of every flavor beans hed gotten from thats what i think it is theyre really and really is harry picked the silvery cloth off the it was strange to the like water woven into an invisibility said a look of awe on his sure it is try it harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and ron gave a look harry looked down at his but they were he dashed to the sure his reflection looked back at just his head suspended in his body completely he pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished a said ron note fell out of harry pulled off the cloak and seized the written in loopy writing he had never seen before were the following your father left this in my possession before he it is time it was returned to use it a very merry christmas to there was no harry stared at the ron was admiring the give anything for one of he whats the said he felt very who had sent the had it really once belonged to his before he could say or think anything the dormitory door was flung open and fred and george weasley bounded harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of he didnt feel like sharing it with anyone else look harrys got a weasley fred and george were wearing blue one with a large yellow f on the other a is better than said holding up harrys obviously makes more of an effort if youre not arent you wearing george get it theyre lovely and hate ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his havent got a letter on george suppose she thinks you dont forget your but were not stupid we know were called gred and all th is percy weasley stuck his head through the looking he had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as carried a lumpy sweater over his which fred for get it come were all wearing even harry got dont want said percy as the twins forced the sweater over his knocking his glasses youre not sitting with the prefects said is a time for they frog marched percy from the his arms pinned to his side by his harry had never in all his life had such a christmas a hundred roast mountains of roast and boiled platters of tureens of buttered silver boats of rich gravy and cranberry sauce and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the these fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble muggle ones the dursleys usually with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats harry pulled a wizard cracker with fred and it didnt just it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue while from the inside exploded a rear admirals hat and several white up at the high dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizards hat for a flowered and was chuckling merrily at a joke professor flitwick had just read flaming christmas puddings followed the percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his harry watched hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more finally kissing professor mcgonagall on the to harrys giggled and her top hat when harry finally left the he was laden down with a stack of things out of the including a pack of luminous a grow your own warts and his own new wizard chess the white mice had disappeared and harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as norriss christmas harry and the weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the and gasping for they returned to the fire in the gryffindor common where harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to he suspected he wouldnt have lost so badly if percy hadnt tried to help him so after a meal of turkey and christmas everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch percy chase fred and george all over gryffindor tower because theyd stolen his prefect it had been harrys best christmas day yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother fell asleep almost as soon as hed drawn the curtains of his four harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under his this had been his he let the material flow over his smoother than light as use it the note had he had to try he slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around looking down at his he saw only moonlight and it was a very funny use it harry felt wide the whole of hogwarts was open to him in this excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and he could go anywhere in and filch would never ron grunted in his should harry wake something held him back his fathers cloak he felt that this time the first time he wanted to use it he crept out of the down the across the common and climbed through the portrait squawked the fat harry said he walked quickly down the where should he he his heart and and then it came to the restricted section in the hed be able to read as long as he as long as it took to find out who flamel he set drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he the library was pitch black and very harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of the lamp looked as if it was floating along in and even though harry could feel his arm supporting the sight gave him the the restricted section was right at the back of the step ping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the he held up his lamp to read the they didnt tell him their faded gold letters spelled words in languages harry couldnt some had no title at one book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like the hairs on the back of harrys neck maybe he was imagining maybe but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the as though they knew someone was there who shouldnt he had to start setting the lamp down carefully on the he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking a large black and silver volume caught his he pulled it out with because it was very balancing it on his let it fall a bloodcurdling shriek split the silence the book was harry snapped it but the shriek went on and one earsplitting he stumbled backward and knocked over his which went out at he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside stuffing the shrieking book back on the he ran for he passed filch in the filchs wild eyes looked straight through and harry slipped under filchs outstretched arm and streaked off up the the books shrieks still ringing in his he came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of he had been so busy getting away from the he hadnt paid attention to where he was perhaps because it was he didnt recognize where he was at there was a suit of armor near the he but he must be five floors above asked me to come directly to if anyone was wandering around at and somebodys been in the library restricted harry felt the blood drain out of his wherever he filch must know a because his greasy voice was getting and to his it was snape who restricted they cant be well catch harry stood rooted to the spot as filch and snape came around the corner they couldnt see of but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer theyd knock right into him the cloak didnt stop him from being he backed away as quietly as he a door stood ajar to his it was his only he squeezed through holding his trying not to move and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing they walked straight and harry leaned against the breathing listening to their footsteps dying that had been very it was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden it looked like an unused the dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the and there was an upturned wastepaper basket but propped against the wall facing him was something that didnt look as if it belonged something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the it was a magnificent as high as the with an ornate gold standing on two clawed there was an inscription carved around the erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on his panic fading now that there was no sound of filch and harry moved nearer to the wanting to look at himself but see no reflection he stepped in front of he had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from he whirled his heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed for he had seen not only himself in the but a whole crowd of people standing right behind but the room was breathing very he turned slowly back to the there he reflected in white and scared and reflected behind were at least ten harry looked over his shoulder but no one was or were they all was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirrors trick was that it reflected invisible or he looked in the mirror a woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and he reached out a hand and felt the air behind if she was really hed touch their reflections were so close but he felt only air she and the others existed only in the she was a very pretty she had dark red hair and her eyes her eyes are just like harry edging a little closer to the bright green exactly the same but then he noticed that she was but crying at the same the black haired man standing next to her put his arm around he wore and his hair was very it stuck up at the just as harrys harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his he they just looked at and harry looked into the faces of the other people in the and saw other pairs of green eyes like other noses like even a little old man who looked as though he had harrys knobbly knees harry was looking at his for the first time in his the potters smiled and waved at harry and he stared hungrily back at his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach he had a powerful kind of ache inside half half terrible how long he stood he didnt the reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his he couldnt stay he had to find his way back to he tore his eyes away from his mothers come and hurried from the could have woken me said can come im going i want to show you the like to see your mom and ron said i want to see all your all the youll be able to show me your other brothers and can see them any old said come round my house this maybe it only shows dead shame about not finding have some bacon or why arent you eating harry couldnt he had seen his parents and would be seeing them again he had almost forgotten about it didnt seem very important who cared what the three headed dog was what did it matter if snape stole you all said look what harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room with ron covered in the they had to walk much more slowly the next they tried retracing harrys route from the wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an said forget it and go harry i know its here they passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite but saw no one just as ron started moaning that his feet were dead with harry spotted the suit of here just here they pushed the door harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the there they his mother and father beamed at the sight of harry cant see look at them there are loads of can only see in it go stand where i harry stepped but with ron in front of the he couldnt see his family just ron in his paisley was staring transfixed at his at he you see all your family standing around im alone but im different i look older and im head am im wearing the badge like bill used to and im holding the house cup and the quidditch cup im quidditch ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at you think this mirror shows the can all my family are dead let me have another look had it to yourself all last give me a bit more only holding the quidditch whats interesting about i want to see my push me a sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their they hadnt realized how loudly they had been ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of norris came round the ron and harry stood quite both thinking the same thing did the cloak work on after what seemed an she turned and isnt safe she might have gone for i bet she heard come and ron pulled harry out of the the snow still hadnt melted the next to play said dont we go down and visit you know what youre thinking that dont go back ive just got a bad feeling about it and youve had too many close shaves and norris are wandering so what if they cant see what if they walk into what if you knock something sound like dont but harry only had one thought in his which was to get back in front of the and ron wasnt going to stop that third night he found his way more quickly than he was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was but he didnt meet and there were his mother and father smiling at him and one of his grandfathers nodding harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the there was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his nothing at except back harry felt as though his insides had turned to he looked behind sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than albus harry must have walked straight past so desperate to get to the mirror he hadnt noticed i didnt see how nearsighted being invisible can make said and harry was relieved to see that he was said slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with like hundreds before have discovered the delights of the mirror of didnt know it was called i expect youve realized by now what it well it shows me my family it showed your friend ron himself as head did you know dont need a cloak to become said dumbledore can you think what the mirror of erised shows us harry shook his me the happiest man on earth would be able to use the mirror of erised like a normal that he would look into it and see himself exactly as he does that harry then he said shows us what we whatever we and said dumbledore shows us nothing more or less than the most desperate desire of our who have never known your see them standing around ronald who has always been overshadowed by his sees himself standing the best of all of this mirror will give us neither knowledge or men have wasted away before entranced by what they have or been driven not knowing if what it shows is real or even mirror will be moved to a new home and i ask you not to go looking for it if you ever do run across you will now be it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to remember why dont you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to harry stood professor can i ask you youve just done dumbledore may ask me one more do you see when you look in the i see myself holding a pair of woolen harry can never have enough said christmas has come and gone and i didnt get a single people will insist on giving me it was only when he was back in bed that it struck harry that dumbledore might not have been quite but he as he shoved scabbers off his it had been quite a personal chapter thirteen nicolas flamel dumbledore had convinced harry not to go looking for the mirror of erised and for the rest of the christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his harry wished he could forget what hed seen in the mirror as but he he started having over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green while a high voice cackled with dumbledore was that mirror could drive you said when harry told him about these who came back the day before term took a different view of she was torn between horror at the idea of harry being out of roaming the school three nights in a row filch had caught and disappointment that he hadnt at least found out who nicolas flamel they had almost given up hope of ever finding flamel in a li brary even though harry was still sure hed read the name once term had they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their harry had even less time than the other because quidditch practice had started wood was working the team harder than even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldnt dampen his the weasleys complained that wood was becoming a but harry was on woods if they won their next against they would overtake slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven quite apart from wanting to harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after during one particularly wet and muddy practice wood gave the team a bit of bad hed just gotten very angry with the who kept dive bombing each other and pretending to fall off their you stop messing he exactly the sort of thing thatll lose us the snapes refereeing this and hell be looking for any excuse to knock points off george weasley really did fall off his broom at these he spluttered through a mouthful of he ever refereed a quidditch hes not going to be fair if we might overtake the rest of the team landed next to george to not my said just got to make sure we play a clean so snape hasnt got an excuse to pick on which was all very thought but he had another reason for not wanting snape near him while he was playing the rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of but harry headed straight back to the gryffindor common where he found ron and hermione playing chess was the only thing hermione ever lost something harry and ron thought was very good for talk to me for a said ron when harry sat down next to need to concen he caught sight of harrys the matter with you look speaking quietly so that no one else would harry told the other two about snapes sinister desire to be a quidditch said hermione at youre said to break your hermione break your said said isnt a reserve if i back gryffindor cant play at at that moment neville toppled into the common how he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyones because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the leg locker he must have had to bunny hop all the way up to gryffindor everyone fell over laughing except who leapt up and performed the nevilles legs sprang apart and he got to his hermione asked leading him over to sit with harry and said neville met him outside the he said hed been looking for someone to practice that to professor hermione urged neville shook his dont want more he got to stand up to said used to walking all over but thats no reason to lie down in front of him and make it no need to tell me im not brave enough to be in malfoys already done neville choked harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a chocolate the very last one from the box hermione had given him for he gave it to who looked as though he might worth twelve of harry sorting hat chose you for didnt and wheres in stinking nevilles lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the i think ill go to dyou want the you collect dont as neville walked harry looked at the famous wizard he was the first one i ever he he stared at the back of the then he looked up at ron and found he found i told you id read the name somewhere i read it on the train coming here listen to dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragons and his work on alchemy with his nicolas hermione jumped to her she hadnt looked so excited since theyd gotten back the marks for their very first piece of she and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls harry and ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing an enormous old book in her never thought to look in she whispered got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light said but hermione told him to be quiet until shed looked something and started flicking frantically through the muttering to at last she found what she was looking knew i knew we allowed to speak said ron hermione ignored she whispered the only known maker of the sorcerers this didnt have quite the effect shed said harry and dont you two look read she pushed the book toward and harry and ron the ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the sorcerers a legendary substance with astonishing the stone will transform any metal into pure it also produces the elixir of which will make the drinker there have been many reports of the sorcerers stone over the but the only stone currently in existence belongs to nicolas the noted alchemist and opera who celebrated his six hundred and sixty fifth birthday last enjoys a quiet life in devon with his perenelle hundred and fifty said when harry and ron had dog must be guarding flamels sorcerers i bet he asked dumbledore to keep it safe for because theyre friends and he knew someone was after thats why he wanted the stone moved out of stone that makes gold and stops you from ever said wonder snapes after anyone would want no wonder we couldnt find flamel in that study of recent developments in said not exactly recent if hes six hundred and sixty is the next morning in defense against the dark while copying down different ways of treating werewolf harry and ron were still discussing what theyd do with a sorcerers stone if they had it wasnt until ron said hed buy his own quidditch team that harry remembered about snape and the coming going to he told ron and i all the slytherins will think im just too scared to face ill show itll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we as long as were not wiping you off the said as the match drew harry became more and more whatever he told ron and the rest of the team wasnt too the idea of overtaking slytherin in the house championship was no one had done it for seven but would they be allowed with such a biased harry didnt know whether he was imagining it or but he seemed to keep running into snape wherever he at he even wondered whether snape was following trying to catch him on his potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly snape was so horrible to could snape possibly know theyd found out about the sorcerers harry didnt see how he could yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that snape could read harry when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next that ron and hermione were wondering whether theyd ever see him alive this wasnt what youd call harry hardly heard a word of woods pep talk as he pulled on his quidditch robes and picked up his nimbus two ron and had found a place in the stands next to who couldnt understand why they looked so grim and or why they had both brought their wands to the little did harry know that ron and hermione had been secretly practicing the leg locker theyd gotten the idea from malfoy using it on and were ready to use it on snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt dont its locomotor hermione muttered as ron slipped his wand up his ron back in the locker wood had taken harry want to pressure but if we ever need an early capture of the snitch its finish the game before snape can favor hufflepuff too whole schools out said fred peering out of the blimey dumbledores come to harrys heart did a he dashing to the door to make fred was there was no mistaking that silver harry could have laughed out loud with relief he was there was simply no way that snape would dare to try to hurt him if dumbledore was perhaps that was why snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the something that ron never seen snape look so he told theyre off someone had poked ron in the back of the it was didnt see you malfoy grinned broadly at crabbe and how long potters going to stay on his broom this anyone want a what about ron didnt snape had just awarded hufflepuff a penalty because george weasley had hit a bludger at who had all her fingers crossed in her was squinting fixedly at who was circling the game like a looking for the know how i think they choose people for the gryffindor said malfoy loudly a few minutes as snape awarded hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at people they feel sorry theres whos got no then theres the whove got no money you should be on the youve got no neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face worth twelve of he and goyle howled with but still not daring to take his eyes from the tell if brains were gold youd be poorer than and thats saying rons nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about warning malfoy one more word said hermione harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular which drew gasps and cheers from the hermione stood her crossed fingers in her as harry streaked toward the ground like a in potters obviously spotted some money on the said ron before malfoy knew what was ron was on top of wrestling him to the neville then clambered over the back of his seat to hermione leaping onto her seat to watch as harry sped straight at snape she didnt even notice malfoy and ron rolling around under her or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was and up in the snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past missing him by inches the next harry had pulled out of the his arm raised in the snitch clasped in his the stands it had to be a no one could ever remember the snitch being caught so where are the games harrys weve gryffindor is in the shrieked dancing up and down on her seat and hugging parvati patil in the row in harry jumped off his a foot from the he couldnt believe hed done it the game was it had barely lasted five as gryffindors came spilling onto the he saw snape land white faced and tight lipped then harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into dumbledores smiling said dumbledore so that only harry could to see you havent been brooding about that been keeping snape spat bitterly on the harry left the locker room alone some time to take his nimbus two thousand back to the he couldnt ever remember feeling hed really done something to be proud of now no one could say he was just a famous name any the evening air had never smelled so he walked over the damp reliving the last hour in his which was a happy gryffindors running to lift him onto their ron and hermione in the jumping up and ron cheering through a heavy harry had reached the he leaned against the wooden door and looked up at with its windows glowing red in the setting gryffindor in the hed done hed shown and speaking of a hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the clearly not wanting to be it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden harrys victory faded from his mind as he he recognized the figures prowling sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner what was going harry jumped back on his nimbus two thousand and took gliding silently over the castle he saw snape enter the forest at a he the trees were so thick he couldnt see where snape had he flew in lower and brushing the top branches of trees until he heard he glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech he climbed carefully along one of the holding tight to his trying to see through the in a shadowy stood but he wasnt quirrell was harry couldnt make out the look on his but he was stuttering worse than harry strained to catch what they were d dont know why you wanted t t to meet here of all p i thought wed keep this said his voice arent supposed to know about the sorcerers after harry leaned quirrell was mumbling snape interrupted you found out how to get past that beast of hagrids b but i dont want me as your said taking a step toward i dont know what you know perfectly well what i an owl hooted and harry nearly fell out of the he steadied himself in time to hear snape your little bit of hocus im but i d d dont snape cut have another little chat when youve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties he threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the it was almost dark but harry could see standing quite still as though he was where have you hermione you we shouted thumping harry on the i gave malfoy a black and neville tried to take on crabbe and goyle single hes still out cold but madam pomftey says hell be all right talk about showing everyones waiting for you in the common were having a fred and george stole some cakes and stuff from the mind that said harry find an empty you wait til you hear he made sure peeves wasnt inside before shutting the door behind then he told them what hed seen and we were it is the sorcerers and snapes trying to force quirrell to help him get he asked if he knew how to get past fluffy and he said something about quirrells hocus pocuss i reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from loads of and quirrell would have done some anti dark arts spell that snape needs to break through you mean the stones only safe as long as quirrell stands up to said hermione in be gone by next said chapter fourteen norbert the norwegian ridgeback must have been braver than theyd in the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and but it didnt look as though hed cracked every time they passed the third floor and hermione would press their ears to the door to check that fluffy was still growling snape was sweeping about in his usual bad which surely meant that the stone was still whenever harry passed quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of and ron had started telling people off for laughing at quirrells had more on her mind than the sorcerers she had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her harry and ron wouldnt have but she kept nagging them to do the the exams are ages hermione not thats like a second to nicolas were not six hundred years ron reminded what are you studying you already know it am i studying are you you realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second theyre very i should have started studying a month i dont know whats gotten into the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as they piled so much homework on them that the easter holidays werent nearly as much fun as the christmas it was hard to relax with hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragons blood or practicing wand moaning and harry and ron spent most of their free time in the library with trying to get through all their extra never remember ron burst out one throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library it was the first really fine day theyd had in the sky was a forget me not and there was a feeling in the air of summer who was looking up in one thousand magical herbs and didnt look up until he heard ron what are you doing in the hagrid shuffled into hiding something behind his he looked very out of place in his moleskin he in a shifty voice that got their interest at whatre you lot up he looked suddenly not still lookin fer nicolas are we found out who he is ages said ron we know what that dogs its a sorcerers st hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was go shoutin about whats the matter with are a few things we wanted to ask as a matter of said whats guarding the stone apart from fluffy said hagrid come an see me im not promisin ill tell yeh but don go rabbitin about it in students aren spposed ter theyll think ive told yeh you said hagrid shuffled was he hiding behind his said hermione you think it had anything to do with the going to see what section he was said whod had enough of he came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the he was looking up stuff about look at dragon species of great britain and from egg to a dragon keepers always wanted a he told me so the first time i ever met said its against our said breeding was outlawed by the warlocks convention of everyone knows its hard to stop muggles from noticing us if were keeping dragons in

hushing them i can tell our kind have to keep putting spells on muggles whove spotted to make them what on earths hagrid up said when they knocked on the door of the gamekeepers hut an hour they were surprised to see that all the curtains were hagrid called is before he let them and then shut the door quickly behind it was stifling hot even though it was such a warm there was a blazing fire in the hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat which they yeh wanted to ask me said there was no point beating around the were wondering if you could tell us whats guarding the sorcerers stone apart from hagrid frowned at course i he i don know number yeh know too much so i wouldn tell yeh if i that stones here fer a good it was almost stolen outta gringotts i sppose yehve worked that out an beats me how yeh even know abou come you might not want to tell but you do you know everything that goes on round said hermione in a flattering hagrids beard twitched and they could tell he was only wondered who had done the hermione went wondered who dumbledore had trusted enough to help apart from hagrids chest swelled at these last harry and ron beamed at i don spose it could hurt ter tell yeh lets he borrowed fluffy from then some o the teachers did professor sprout professor flitwick professor mcgonagall he ticked them off on his quirrell an dumbledore himself did o hang ive forgotten oh professor yer not still on abou are snape helped protect the hes not about ter steal harry knew ron and hermione were thinking the same as he if snape had been in on protecting the it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded he probably knew everything it quirrells spell and how to get past the only one who knows how to get past arent said harry you wouldnt tell would not even one of the a soul knows except me an said hagrid thats harry muttered to the can we have a window im said harry noticed him glance at the harry looked at whats but he already knew what it in the very heart of the underneath the was a black said fiddling nervously with his did you get said crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the mustve cost you a said i was down in the village havin a few drinks an got into a game o cards with a think he was quite glad ter get rid of ter be what are you going to do with it when its said ive bin doin some readin said pulling a large book

brandy mixed with chicken blood every half an see here how ter recognize diffrent eggs what i got theres a norwegian theyre he looked very pleased with but hermione you live in a wooden she but hagrid wasnt he was humming merrily as he stoked the so now they had something else to worry what might happen to hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his what its like to have a peaceful ron as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were hermione had now started making study schedules for harry and it was driving them one breakfast hedwig brought harry another note from he had written only two its ron wanted to skip herbology and go straight down to the hermione wouldnt hear of how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon got well get into and thats nothing to what hagrids going to be in when someone finds out what hes doing harry malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to how much had he harry didnt like the look on malfoys face at ron and hermione argued all the way to herbology and in the hermione agreed to run down to hagrids with the other two during morning when the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the hagrid greeted looking flushed and nearly he ushered them the egg was lying on the there were deep cracks in something was moving a funny clicking noise was coming from they all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated all at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split the baby dragon flopped onto the it wasnt exactly harry thought it looked like a black its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet it had a long snout with wide the stubs of horns and orange it a couple of sparks flew out of its he hagrid he reached out a hand to stroke the dragons it snapped at his showing pointed he knows his said said fast do norwegian ridgebacks hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face he leapt to his feet and ran to the the was lookin through the gap in the curtains its a kid hes runnin back up ter the harry bolted to the door and looked even at a distance there was no mistaking malfoy had seen the something about the smile lurking on malfoys face during the next week made and hermione very they spent most of their free time in hagrids darkened trying to reason with let him harry him said too hed they looked at the it had grown three times in length in just a smoke kept furling out of its hagrid hadnt been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so there were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the decided to call him said looking at the dragon with misty really knows me wheres lost his ron muttered in harrys said harry it two weeks and norberts going to be as long as your malfoy could go to dumbledore at any hagrid bit his i know i cant keep him but i cant jus dump i harry suddenly turned to he losing said charlie your in studying we could send norbert to charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the said about and in the hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to charlie to ask the following week dragged wednesday night found hermione and harry sitting alone in the common long after everyone else had gone to the clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off harrys invisibility he had been down at hagrids helping him feed who was now eating dead rats by the bit he showing them his which was wrapped in a bloody not going to be able to hold a quill for a i tell that dragons the most horrible animal ive ever but the way hagrid goes on about youd think it was a fluffy little bunny when it bit me he told me off for frightening and when i he was singing it a there was a tap on the dark said hurrying to let her have charlies the three of them put their heads together to read the dear how are thanks for the letter id be glad to take the norwegian but it wont be easy getting him i think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next trouble they mustnt be seen carrying an illegal could you get the ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on they can meet you there and take him away while its still send me an answer as soon as charlie they looked at one got the invisibility said shouldnt be too difficult i think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and it was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with anything to get rid of norbert and there was a by the next rons bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual he didnt know whether it was safe to go to madam pomfrey would she recognize a dragon by the he had no the cut had turned a nasty shade of it looked as if norberts fangs were harry and hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find ron in a terrible state in not just my he that feels like its about to fall malfoy told madam pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at he kept threatening to tell her what really bit me ive told her it was a but i dont think she believes me i shouldnt have hit him at the quidditch thats why hes doing harry and hermione tried to calm ron all be over at midnight on said but this didnt soothe ron at on the he sat bolt upright and broke into a on he said in a hoarse no oh no ive just remembered charlies letter was in that book malfoy hes going to know were getting rid of harry and hermione didnt get a chance to madam pomfrey came over at that moment and made them saying ron needed too late to change the plan harry told havent got time to send charlie another and this could be our only chance to get rid of well have to risk and we have got the invisibility malfoy doesnt know about they found the sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell who opened a window to talk to wont let you he at a tricky stage nothin i cant when they told him about charlies his eyes filled with although that might have been because norbert had just bitten him on the its all he only got my boot jus playin hes only a after the baby banged its tail on the making the windows harry and hermione walked back to the castle feeling saturday couldnt come quickly they would have felt sorry for hagrid when the time came for him to say good bye to norbert if they hadnt been so worried about what they had to it was a very cloudy and they were a bit late arriving at hagrids hut because theyd had to wait for peeves to get out of their way in the entrance where hed been playing tennis against the hagrid had norbert packed and ready in a large got lots o rats an some brandy fer the said hagrid in a muffled ive packed his teddy bear in case he gets from inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to harry as though the teddy was having his head torn hagrid as harry and hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it will never forget how they managed to get the crate back up to the they never midnight ticked nearer as they heaved norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark up another then another even one of harrys shortcuts didnt make the work much harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the forgetting that they were already they shrank into the staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet a lamp professor in a tartan bathrobe and a hair had malfoy by the she twenty points from wandering around in the middle of the how dare you dont harry potters coming hes got a utter how dare you tell such come on i shall see professor snape about the steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after not until theyd stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the glad to be able to breathe properly hermione did a sort of got i could harry advised chuckling about they norbert thrashing about in his about ten minutes four broomsticks came swooping down out of the charlies friends were a cheery they showed harry and hermione the harness theyd rigged so they could suspend norbert between they all helped buckle norbert safely into it and then harry and hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very at norbert was they slipped back down the spiral their hearts as light as their now that norbert was off no more dragon malfoy in detention what could spoil their the answer to that was waiting at the foot of the as they stepped into the filchs face loomed suddenly out of the he are in theyd left the invisibility cloak on top of the chapter fifteen the foribidden forest things couldnt have been filch took them down to professor mcgonagalls study on the first where they sat and waited without saying a word to each hermione was and wild cover up stories chased each other around harrys each more feeble than the he couldnt see how they were going to get out of trouble this they were how could they have been so stupid as to forget the there was no reason on earth that professor mcgonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of let alone being up the tallest astronomy which was out of bounds except for add norbert and the invisibility and they might as well be packing their bags had harry thought that things couldnt have been he was when professor mcgonagall she was leading neville burst the moment he saw the other was trying to find you to warn i heard malfoy saying he was going to catch he said you had a drag harry shook his head violently to shut neville but professor mcgonagall had she looked more likely to breathe fire than norbert as she towered over the three of would never have believed it of any of filch says you were up in the astronomy its one oclock in the explain it was the first time hermione had ever failed to answer a teachers she was staring at her as still as a think ive got a good idea of whats been going said professor doesnt take a genius to work it you fed draco malfoy some cock and bull story about a trying to get him out of bed and into ive already caught i suppose you think its funny that longbottom here heard the story and believed harry caught nevilles eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasnt because neville was looking stunned and blundering neville harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the to warn said professor students out of bed in one ive never heard of such a thing miss i thought you had more as for i thought gryffindor meant more to you than all three of you will receive detentions you nothing gives you the right to walk around school at especially these its very dangerous and fifty points will be taken from harry gasped they would lose the the lead hed won in the last quidditch points said professor breathing heavily through her pointed please cant tell me what i can and cant now get back to all of ive never been more ashamed of gryffindor a hundred and fifty points that put gryffindor in last in one theyd ruined any chance gryffindor had had for the house harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his how could they ever make up for harry didnt sleep all he could hear neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like harry couldnt think of anything to say to comfort he knew like was dreading the what would happen when the rest of gryffindor found out what theyd at gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought thered been a how could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than and then the story started to harry the famous harry their hero of two quidditch had lo st them all those him and a couple of other stupid first from being one of the most popular and admired people at the harry was suddenly the most even ravenclaws and hufflepuffs turned on because everyone had been longing to see slytherin lose the house everywhere harry people pointed and didnt trouble to lower their voices as they insulted on the other clapped as he walked past whistling and we owe you only ron stood by all forget this in a few fred and george have lost loads of points in all the time theyve been and people still like never lost a hundred and fifty points in one have said harry ron it was a bit late to repair the but harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that werent his business from now hed had it with sneaking around and he felt so ashamed of himself that he went to wood and offered to resign from the quidditch wood goodll that how are we going to get any points back if we cant win at but even quidditch had lost its the rest of the team wouldnt speak to harry during and if they had to speak about they called him hermione and neville were they didnt have as bad a time as because they werent as well but nobody would speak to hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in keeping her head down and working in harry was almost glad that the exams werent far all the studying he had to do kept his mind off his and hermione kept to working late into the trying to remember the ingredients in complicated learn charms and spells by memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin about a week before the exams were due to harrys new resolution not to interfere in anything that didnt concern him was put to an unexpected walking back from the library on his own one he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up as he drew he heard quirrells no not please it sounded as though someone was threatening harry moved right all right he heard quirrell next quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his he was pale and looked as though he was about to he strode out of harry didnt think quirrell had even noticed he waited until quirrells footsteps had then peered into the it was but a door stood ajar at the other harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what hed promised himself about not all the hed have gambled twelve sorcerers stones that snape had just left the and from what harry had just snape would be walking with a new spring in his step quirrell seemed to have given in at harry went back to the where hermione was testing ron on harry told them what hed done said quirrells told him how to break his anti dark force spell still said snapes found out how to get past him without asking said looking up at the thousands of books surrounding bet theres a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three headed so what do we the light of adventure was kindling again in rons but hermione answered before harry to thats what we should have done ages if we try anything ourselves well be thrown out for weve got no said too scared to back us snapes only got to say he doesnt know how the troll got in at halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor who do you think theyll him or its not exactly a secret we hate dumbledorell think we made it up to get him filch wouldnt help us if his life depended on hes too friendly with and the more students get thrown the hell and dont were not supposed to know about the stone or thatll take a lot of hermione looked but ron we just do a bit of poking around said harry done enough poking he pulled a map of jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its the following notes were delivered to and neville at the breakfast they were all the your detention will take place at eleven oclock meet filch in the entrance professor mcgonagall harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points theyd he half expected hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying but she didnt say a like she felt they deserved what theyd at eleven oclock that they said good bye to ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with filch was already there and so was harry had also forgotten that malfoy had gotten a said lighting a lamp and leading them i bet youll think twice about breaking a school rule wont he leering at hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask its just a pity they let the old punishments die hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few ive got the chains still in my keep em well oiled in case theyre ever off we and dont think of running itll be worse for you if you they marched off across the dark neville kept harry wondered what their punishment was going to it must be something really or filch wouldnt be sounding so the moon was but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into harry could see the lighted windows of hagrids then they heard a distant that hurry i want ter get harrys heart if they were going to be working with hagrid it wouldnt be so his relief must have showed in his because filch suppose you think youll be enjoying yourself with that think boy its into the forest youre going and im much mistaken if youll all

into it they reached a fork in the earth and and hagrid took the left path while and fang took the they walked in their eyes on the every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver blue blood on the fallen harry saw that hagrid looked very a werewolf be killing the harry fast said not easy ter catch a theyre powerful magic i never knew one ter be hurt they walked past a mossy tree harry could hear running there must be a stream somewhere close there were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding all hagrid it cantve gone far if its this badly an then well be able ter get behind that hagrid seized harry and hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering he pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his raising ready to the three of them something was slithering over dead leaves it sounded like a cloak trailing along the hagrid was squinting up the dark but after a few the sound faded knew he summat in here that shouldn harry wasn no werewolf an it wasn no said hagrid follow but they walked more ears straining for the faintest in a clearing something definitely hagrid yerself im and into the clearing came was it a or a to the a with red hair and but below that was a horses gleaming chestnut body with a reddish harry and hermiones jaws its said hagrid in are he walked forward and shook the centaurs evening to said he had a sorrowful you going to shoot be too said patting his summat bad loose in this this is harry potter an hermione by the students up at the an this is you hes a said hermione said are and do you learn up at the said hermione thats ronan he flung back his head and stared at the is bright said glancing im glad weve run inter cause theres a unicorn bin hurt you seen ronan didnt answer he stared unblinkingly then sighed the innocent are the first he it has been for ages so it is said have yeh seen anythin is bright ronan while hagrid watched him but i was meanin anythin unusual a bit nearer said yeh havent noticed anythin yet ronan took a while to at he forest hides many a movement in the trees behind ronan made hagrid raise his bow but it was only a second black haired and bodied and wilder looking than said i hope you are ive jus bin askin you seen anythin odd in here theres a unicorn bin injured would yeh know anythin about bane walked over to stand next to he looked is bright he said said hagrid if either of you do see let me wont well be harry and hermione followed him out of the staring over their shoulders at ronan and bane until the trees blocked their said hagrid an get a straight answer out of a ruddy not interested in anythin closern the there many of them in asked a fair keep themselves to themselves but theyre good enough about turnin up if ever i want a theyre they know jus don let on think that was a centaur we heard said that sound like hooves to if yeh ask that was whats bin killin the unicorns never heard anythin like it they walked on through the dark harry kept looking nervously over his he had the nasty feeling they were being he was very glad they had hagrid and his crossbow with they had just passed a bend in the path when hermione grabbed hagrids red the others are in two wait hagrid on the ill come back for they heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each very until they couldnt hear anything but the rustling of leaves around dont think theyve been do whispered dont care if malfoy but if somethings got its our fault hes here in the first the minutes dragged their ears seemed sharper than harrys seemed to be picking up every sigh of the every cracking what was going where were the at a great crunching noise announced hagrids and fang were with hagrid was it had sneaked up behind neville and grabbed him as a neville had panicked and sent up the be lucky ter catch anythin with the racket you two were were changin groups you stay with me an you go with fang an this im hagrid added in a whisper to hell have a harder time frightenin an weve gotta get this so harry set off into the heart of the forest with malfoy and they walked for nearly half an deeper and deeper into the until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so harry thought the blood seemed to be getting there were splashes on the roots of a as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close harry could see a clearing through the tangled branches of an ancient he holding out his arm to stop something bright white was gleaming on the they inched it was the unicorn all and it was harry had never seen anything so beautiful and its slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly white on the dark harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he a bush on the edge of the clearing out of the a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking and fang stood the cloaked figure reached the lowered its head over the wound in the animals and began to drink its malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted so did the hooded figure raised its head and looked right at harry unicorn blood was dribbling down its it got to its feet and came swiftly toward harry he couldnt move for then a pain like hed never felt before pierced his it was as though his scar were on half he staggered he heard hooves behind and something jumped clean over charging at the the pain in harrys head was so bad he fell to his it took a minute or two to when he looked the figure had a centaur was standing over not ronan or this one looked he had white blond hair and a palomino you all said the pulling harry to his thank you what was the centaur didnt he had astonishingly blue like pale he looked carefully at his eyes lingering on the scar that stood on harrys are the potter he had better get back to the forest is not safe at this time especially for can you it will be quicker this name is he as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that harry could clamber onto his there was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the ronan and bane came bursting through the their flanks heaving and bane are you you have a human on your have you no are you a common you realize who this said is the potter the quicker he leaves this the have you been telling growled we are sworn not to set ourselves against the have we not read what is to come in the movements of the ronan pawed the ground sure firenze thought he was acting for the he said in his gloomy bane kicked his back legs in the what is that to do with centaurs are concerned with what has been it is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in so that harry had to grab his shoulders to stay you not see that firenze bellowed at you not understand why it was or have the planets not let you in on that i set myself against what is lurking in this with humans alongside me if i and firenze whisked with harry clutching on as best he they plunged off into the leaving ronan and bane behind harry didnt have a clue what was going bane so he was that thing you saved me firenze slowed to a warned harry to keep his head bowed in case of low hanging but did not answer harrys they made their way through the trees in silence for so long that harry thought firenze didnt want to talk to him they were passing through a particularly dense patch of when firenze suddenly do you know what unicorn blood is used said startled by the odd only used the horn and tail hair in is because it is a monstrous to slay a said one who has nothing to and everything to would commit such a the blood of a unicorn will keep you even if you are an inch from but at a terrible you have slain something pure and defenseless to save and you will have but a half a cursed from the moment the blood touches your harry stared at the back of firenzes which was dappled silver in the whod be that he wondered youre going to be cursed deaths isnt firenze all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else something that will bring you back to full strength and power something that will mean you can never do you know what is hidden in the school at this very sorcerers of course the elixir of but i dont understand who you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to who has clung to awaiting their it was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around harrys over the rustling of the he seemed to hear once more what hagrid had told him on the night they had say he in my dunno if he had enough human left in him to you harry was vol are you all hermione was running toward them down the hagrid puffing along behind said hardly knowing what he was unicorns its in that clearing back is where i leave firenze murmured as hagrid hurried off to examine the are safe harry slid off his harry said planets have been read wrongly before even by i hope this is one of those he turned and cantered back into the depths of the leaving harry shivering behind ron had fallen asleep in the dark common waiting for them to he shouted something about quidditch fouls when harry roughly shook him in a matter of he was wide eyed as harry began to tell him and hermione what had happened in the harry couldnt sit he paced up and down in front of the he was still wants the stone for and voldemorts waiting in the and all this time we thought snape just wanted to get saying the said ron in a terrified as if he thought voldemort could hear harry wasnt saved but he shouldnt have done bane was he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to they must show that voldemorts coming bane thinks firenze should have let voldemort kill i suppose thats written in the stars as you stop saying the ron all ive got to wait for now is snape to steal the harry went on voldemort will be able to come and finish me i suppose banell be hermione looked very but she had a word of everyone says dumbledores the only one you know who was ever afraid of with dumbledore you know who wont touch who says the centaurs are it sounds like fortune telling to and professor mcgonagall says thats a very imprecise branch of the sky had turned light before they stopped they went to bed their throats but the nights surprises werent when harry pulled back his he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath there was a note pinned to just in chapter sixteen through the trapdoor in years to harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected voldemort to come bursting through the door at any yet the days crept and there could be no doubt that fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked it was sweltering especially in the large classroom where they did their written they had been given new quills for the which had been bewitched with an anticheating they had practical exams as professor flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a professor mcgonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox points were given for how pretty the snuffbox but taken away if it had snape made them all breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a forgetfulness harry did the best he trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the neville thought harry had a bad case of exam nerves because harry couldnt but the truth was that harry kept being woken by his old except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in maybe it was because they hadnt seen what harry had seen in the or because they didnt have scars burning on their but ron and hermione didnt seem as worried about the stone as the idea of voldemort certainly scared but he didnt keep visiting them in and they were so busy with their studying they didnt have much time to fret about what snape or anyone else might be up their very last exam was history of one hour of answering questions about batty old wizards whod invented selfstirring cauldrons and theyd be free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came when the ghost of professor binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their harry couldnt help cheering with the was far easier than i thought it would said hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny neednt have learned about the werewolf code of conduct or the uprising of elfric the hermione always liked to go through their exam papers but ron said this made him feel so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a the weasley twins and lee jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant which was basking in the warm more ron sighed stretching out on the could look more weve got a week before we find out how badly weve theres no need to worry harry was rubbing his wish i knew what this he burst out scar keeps hurting its happened but never as often as to madam hermione not said think its a it means dangers ron couldnt get worked it was too hermiones the stones safe as long as dumbledores weve never had any proof snape found out how to get past he nearly had his leg ripped off hes not going to try it again in a and neville will play quidditch for england before hagrid lets dumbledore harry but he couldnt shake off a lurking feeling that there was something hed forgotten to something when he tried to explain hermione just the i woke up last night and was halfway through my transfiguration notes before i remembered wed done that harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didnt have anything to do with he watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue a note clamped in its hagrid was the only one who ever sent him hagrid would never betray hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past but harry suddenly jumped to his you said ron just thought of said he had turned got to go and see panted hurrying to keep you think its a bit said scrambling up the grassy what hagrid wants more than anything else is a and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his how many people wander around with dragon eggs if its against wizard lucky they found dont you why didnt i see it are you talking said but sprinting across the grounds toward the didnt hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his his trousers and sleeves were rolled and he was shelling peas into a large he yer got time fer a said but harry cut him were in a ive got to ask you you know that night you won what did the stranger you were playing cards with look said hagrid wouldn take his cloak he saw the three of them look stunned and raised his not that yeh get a lot o funny folk in the hogs head thats the pub down in the mighta bin a dragon mightn i never saw his he kept his hood harry sank down next to the bowl of did you talk to him did you mention hogwarts at come said frowning as he tried to he asked what i an i told him i was gamekeeper he asked a bit about the sorta creatures i took so i told an i said what id always really wanted was a an i can remember too cause he kept buyin me lets then he said he had the dragon egg an we could play cards fer it if i but he had ter be sure i could handle he didn want it ter go ter any old so i told after a dragon would be did he did he seem interested in harry try ing to keep his voice yeah how many three headed dogs dyeh even around so i told fluffys a piece o cake if yeh know how to calm him jus play him a bit o music an hell go straight off ter sleep hagrid suddenly looked shouldnta told yeh he blurted i said hey wherere yeh and hermione didnt speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance which seemed very cold and gloomy after the got to go to said told that stranger how to get past and it was either snape or voldemort under that cloak it mustve been once hed got hagrid i just hope dumbledore believes firenze might back us up if bane doesnt stop wheres dumbledores they looked as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right they had never been told where dumbledore nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see just have to harry but a voice suddenly rang across the are you three doing it was professor carrying a large pile of want to see professor said rather harry and ron professor professor mcgonagall as though this was a very fishy thing to want to harry swallowed now sort of he but he wished at once he because professor mcgonagalls nostrils dumbledore left ten minutes she said received an urgent owl from the ministry of magic and flew off for london at said harry dumbledore is a very great he has many demands on his time this is you have to say is more important than the ministry of said throwing caution to the its about the sorcerers tone whatever professor mcgonagall had it wasnt the books she was carrying tumbled out of her but she didnt pick them do you know she i think i know that sn that someones going to try and steal the ive got to talk to professor she eyed him with a mixture of shock and dumbledore will be back she said i dont know how you found out about the but rest no one can possibly steal its too well professor i know what im talking she said she bent down and gathered up the fallen i suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the but they said once he was sure professor mcgonagall was out of going through the trapdoor hes found out everything he and now hes got dumbledore out of the he sent that i bet the ministry of magic will get a real shock when dumbledore turns what can we hermione harry and ron wheeled snape was standing he said they stared at shouldnt be inside on a day like he with an twisted were harry without any idea what he was going to want to be more said around like people will think youre up to and gryffindor really cant afford to lose any more can harry they turned to go but snape called them potter any more nighttime wanderings and i will personally make sure you are good day to he strode off in the direction of the out on the stone harry turned to the heres what weve got to he whispered of us has got to keep an eye on snape wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves youd better do said can pretend to be waiting for professor you he put on a high professor im so i think i got question fourteen b shut said but she agreed to go and watch out for wed better stay outside the third floor harry told but that part of the plan didnt no sooner had they reached the door separating fluffy from the rest of the school than professor mcgonagall turned up again and this she lost her suppose you think youre harder to get past than a pack of she of this if i hear you ve come anywhere near here ill take another fifty points from from my own harry and ron went back to the common harry had just least hermiones on snapes when the portrait of the fat lady swung open and hermione came she came out and asked me what i was so i said i was waiting for and snape went to get and ive only just got i dont know where snape thats it isnt harry the other two stared at he was pale and his eyes were going out of here tonight and im going to try and get to the stone said said what mcgonagall and snape have youll be harry you if snape gets hold of the voldemorts coming havent you heard what it was like when he was trying to take there wont be any hogwarts to get expelled hell flatten or turn it into a school for the dark losing points doesnt matter cant you dyou think hell leave you and your families alone if gryffindor wins the house if i get caught before i can get to the ill have to go back to the dursleys and wait for voldemort to find me its only dying a bit later than i would because im never going over to the dark im going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop voldemort killed my he glared at right said hermione in a small use the invisibility said just lucky i got it will it cover all three of said all three of come off you dont think wed let you go course said hermione do you think youd get to the stone without id better go and took through my there might be something if we get you two will be if i can help said hermione told me in secret that i got a hundred and twelve percent on his theyre not throwing me out after after dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common nobody bothered none of the gryffindors had anything to say to harry any after this was the first night he hadnt been upset by hermione was skimming through all her hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to harry and ron didnt talk both of them were thinking about what they were about to the room emptied as people drifted off to get the ron as lee jordan finally stretching and harry ran upstairs to their dark he putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute hagrid had given him for he pocketed it to use on fluffy he didnt feel much like he ran back down to the common better put the cloak on and make sure it covers all three of us if filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own are you said a voice from the corner of the neville appeared from behind an clutching trevor the who looked as though hed been making another bid for said hurriedly putting the cloak behind his neville stared at their guilty going out he said were why dont you go to harry looked at the grandfather clock by the they couldnt afford to waste any more snape might even now be playing fluffy to cant go said be caught gryffindor will be in even more dont said is but neville was clearly steeling himself to do something i wont let you do he hurrying to stand in front of the portrait ill fight away from that hole and dont be an idiot you call me an said i dont think you should be breaking any more and you were the one who told me to stand up to but not to said ron in you dont know what youre he took a step forward and neville dropped trevor the who leapt out of on try and hit said raising his harry turned to he said hermione stepped she really sorry about she raised her she pointing it at nevilles arms snapped to his his legs sprang his whole body he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his stiff as a hermione ran to turn him nevilles jaws were jammed together so he couldnt only his eyes were looking at them in you done to harry the full body said hermione im so had no time to said understand said ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility but leaving neville lying motionless on the floor didnt feel like a very good in their nervous every statues shadow looked like every distant breath of wind sounded like peeves swooping down on at the foot of the first set of they spotted norris skulking near the lets kick just this ron whispered in harrys but harry shook his as they climbed carefully around norris turned her lamplike eyes on but didnt do they didnt meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third peeves was bobbing halfway loosening the carpet so that people would he said suddenly as they climbed toward he narrowed his wicked black youre even if i cant see are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student he rose up in the air and floated squinting at call i if somethings a creeping around harry had a sudden he in a hoarse bloody baron has his own reasons for being peeves almost fell out of the air in he caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the your he said my mistake i didnt see you of course i youre invisible forgive old peevsie his little have business croaked away from this place i most certainly said rising up in the air your business goes ill not bother and he scooted off whispered a few seconds they were outside the third floor corridor and the door was already there you harry said already got past seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing underneath the harry turned to the other you want to go i wont blame he can take the i wont need it be said said harry pushed the door as the door rumbling growls met their all three of the dogs noses sniffed madly in their even though it couldnt see that at its hermione like a said must have left it must wake up the moment you stop said here he put hagrids flute to his lips and it wasnt really a but from the first note the beasts eyes began to harry hardly drew the dogs growls ceased it tottered on its paws and fell to its then it slumped to the fast ron warned harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the they could feel the dogs smelly breath as they approached the giant think well be able to pull the door said peering over the dogs to go i ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dogs he bent and pulled the ring of the which swung up and can you hermione said just black theres no way of climbing well just have to who was still playing the waved at ron to get his attention and pointed at want to go are you said dont know how deep this thing give the flute to hermione so she can keep him harry handed the flute in the few seconds the dog growled and but the moment hermione began to it fell back into its deep harry climbed over it and looked down through the there was no sign of the he lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his then he looked up at ron and anything happens to dont go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to said you in a i and harry let damp air rushed past him as he fell down and with a muffled sort of thump he landed on something he sat up and felt his eyes not used to the it felt as though he was sitting on some sort of he called up to the light the size of a postage which was the open a soft you can ron followed right he sprawled next to this were his first some sort of plant i suppose its here to break the come the distant music there was a loud bark from the but hermione had already she landed on harrys other must be miles under the school she this plant things said shrieked at you she leapt up and struggled toward a damp she had to struggle because the moment she had the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her as for harry and their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off but the more they strained against the tighter and faster the plant wound around hermione ordered know what this is its devils im so glad we know what its thats a great snarled leaning trying to stop the plant from curling around his im trying to remember how to kill said hurry i cant harry wrestling with it as it curled around his devils what did professor sprout it likes the dark and the damp light a harry of course but theres no hermione wringing her you gone ron you a witch or said and she whipped out her waved muttered and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on snape at the in a matter of the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and wriggling and it unraveled itself from their and they were able to pull you pay attention in said harry as he joined her by the wiping sweat off his said lucky harry doesnt lose his head in a crisis theres no said pointing down a stone which was the only way all they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the the passageway sloped and harry was reminded of with an unpleasant jolt of the he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards if they met a a fully grown dragon norbert had been bad you hear ron harry a soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up you think its a dont sounds like wings to light ahead i can see something they reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit its ceiling arching high above it was full of jewel bright fluttering and tumbling all around the on the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden you think theyll attack us if we cross the said said dont look very but i suppose if they all swooped down at theres no other ill he took a deep covered his face with his and sprinted across the he expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any but nothing he reached the door he pulled the but it was the other two followed they tugged and heaved at the but it wouldnt not even when hermione tried her alohomora said they cant be here just for said they watched the birds soaring glittering not harry said winged keys look so that must he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of yes weve got to catch the key to the there are hundreds of ron examined the lock on the looking for a old fashioned one probably like the they each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the soaring into the midst of the cloud of they grabbed and but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch not for was harry the youngest seeker in a he had a knack for spotting things other people after a minutes weaving about through the whirl of rainbow he noticed a large silver key that had a bent as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the he called to the big one there there with bright blue wings the feathers are all crumpled on one ron went speeding in the direction that harry was crashed into the and nearly fell off his got to close in on harry not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged you come at it from above stay below and stop it from going down and ill try and catch ron hermione rocketed the key dodged them and harry streaked after it sped toward the harry leaned forward and with a crunching pinned it against the stone with one ron and hermiones cheers echoed around the high they landed and harry ran to the the key struggling in his he rammed it into the lock and turned it the moment the lock had clicked the key took flight looking very battered now that it had been caught harry asked the other his hand on the door they he pulled the door the next chamber was so dark they couldnt see anything at but as they stepped into light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing they were standing on the edge of a huge behind the black which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black facing way across the were the white ron and hermione shivered slightly the towering white chessmen had no what do we harry isnt said got to play our way across the behind the white pieces they could see another said hermione said going to have to be he walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knights at the stone sprang to the horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at we er have to join you to get the black knight ron turned to the other needs thinking about he i suppose weve got to take the place of three of the black harry and hermione stayed watching ron finally he dont be offended or but neither of you are that good at chess not said harry tell us what to you take the place of that and you next to him instead of that about going to be a said the chessmen seemed to have been because at these words a a and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the leaving three empty squares that and hermione always plays first in said peering across the a white pawn had moved forward two ron started to direct the black they moved silently wherever he sent harrys knees were what if they move diagonally four squares to the their first real shock came when their other knight was the white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the where he lay quite to let that said looking you free to take that go every time one of their men was the white pieces showed no soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the ron only just noticed in time that harry and hermione were in he himself darted around the taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black nearly he muttered me think let me the white queen turned her blank face toward said ron the only ive got to be harry and hermione snapped got to make some i take one step forward and shell take me that leaves you free to checkmate the you want to stop snape or if you dont hurry hell already have the there was no ron his face pale but i go dont hang around once youve he stepped and the white queen she struck ron hard across the head with her stone and he crashed to the floor hermione screamed but stayed on her square the white queen dragged ron to one he looked as if hed been knocked harry moved three spaces to the the white king took off his crown and threw it at harrys they had the chessmen parted and leaving the door ahead with one last desperate look back at harry and hermione charged through the door and up the next if hes be all said trying to convince do you reckons had that was the devils flitwick mustve put charms on the mcgonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them that leaves quirrells and they had reached another harry harry pushed it a disgusting smell filled their making both of them pull their robes up over their eyes they flat on the floor in front of a troll even larger than the one they had out cold with a bloody lump on its glad we didnt have to fight that harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive i cant he pulled open the next both of them hardly daring to look at what came next but there was nothing very frightening in just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a said do we have to they stepped over the and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the it wasnt ordinary fire it was at the same black flames shot up in the doorway leading they were hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the harry looked over her shoulder to read danger lies before while safety lies two of us will help which ever you would one among us seven will let you move another will transport the drinker back two among our number hold only nettle three of us are waiting bidden in unless you wish to stay here to help you in your we give you these clues however slyly the poison tries to hide you will always find some on nettle wines left different are those who stand at either but if you would move neither is your as you see all are different neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their the second left and the second on the right are twins once you taste though different at first hermione let out a great sigh and saw that she was the very last thing he felt like said isnt magic its logic a a lot of the greatest wizards havent got an ounce of theyd be stuck in here so will wont course said we need is here on this seven three are two are one will get us safely through the black and one will get us back through the how do we know which to me a hermione read the paper several then she walked up and down the line of muttering to herself and pointing at at she clapped her she smallest bottle will get us through the black fire toward the harry looked at the tiny only enough there for one of he hardly one they looked at each one will get you back through the purple hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the drink said get back and get grab brooms from the flying key theyll get you out of the trapdoor and past fluffy go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to we need i might be able to hold snape off for a but im no match for harry what if you know whos with i was lucky wasnt said pointing at his might get lucky hermiones lip and she suddenly dashed at harry and threw her arms around youre a great you not as good as said very as she let go of said and there are more important things friendship and bravery and oh harry be drink said are sure which is arent said she took a long drink from the round bottle at the and not said harry but its like before it wears luck take hermione turned and walked straight through the purple harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest he turned to face the black i he and he drained the little bottle in one it was indeed as though ice was flooding his he put the bottle down and walked he braced saw the black flames licking his but couldnt feel them for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire then he was on the other in the last there was already someone there but it wasnt it wasnt even chapter seventeen the man with two faces it was gasped quirrell his face wasnt twitching at he said wondered whether id be meeting you i thought snape quirrell and it wasnt his usual quivering but cold and severus does seem the doesnt so useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown next to who would suspect p p st stuttering p professor harry couldnt take it this couldnt be it snape tried to kill i tried to kill your friend miss granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to snape at that quidditch she broke my eye contact with another few seconds and id have got you off that id have managed it before then if snape hadnt been muttering a trying to save was trying to save said quirrell do you think he wanted to referee your next he was trying to make sure i didnt do it he neednt have i couldnt do anything with dumbledore all the other teachers thought snape was trying to stop gryffindor from he did make himself and what a waste of when after all im going to kill you quirrell snapped his ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around too nosy to scurrying around the school on halloween like for all i knew youd seen me coming to look at what was guarding the let the troll i have a special gift with trolls you must have seen what i did to the one in the chamber back while everyone else was running around looking for who already suspected went straight to the third floor to head me off and not only did my troll fail to beat you to that three headed dog didnt even manage to bite snapes leg off wait i need to examine this interesting it was only then that harry realized what was standing behind it was the mirror of mirror is the key to finding the quirrell tapping his way around the dumbledore to come up with something like but hes in ill be far away by the time he gets all harry could think of doing was to keep quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the saw you and snape in the forest he blurted said quirrell walking around the mirror to look at the was on to me by that trying to find out how far id he suspected me all tried to frighten me as though he when i had lord voldemort on my quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into see the im presenting it to my but where is harry struggled against the ropes binding but they didnt he had to keep quirrell from giving his whole attention to the snape always seemed to hate me so he said quirrell he was at hogwarts with your didnt you they loathed each but he never wanted you i heard you a few days sobbing i thought snape was threatening for the first a spasm of fear flitted across quirrells he find it hard to follow my masters instructions he is a great wizard and i am weak mean he was there in the classroom with harry is with me wherever i said quirrell met him when i traveled around the a foolish young man i was full of ridiculous ideas about good and lord voldemort showed me how wrong i there is no good and there is only and those too weak to seek since i have served him although i have let him down many he has had to be very hard on quirrell shivered does not forgive mistakes when i failed to steal the stone from he was most he punished decided he would have to keep a closer watch on quirrells voice trailed harry was remembering his trip to diagon alley how could he have been so hed seen quirrell there that very shaken hands with him in the leaky quirrell cursed under his dont is the stone inside the should i break harrys mind was what i want more than anything else in the world at the he is to find the stone before quirrell so if i look in the i should see myseff finding it which means ill see where its but how can i look without quirrell realizing what im up he tried to edge to the to get in front of the glass without quirrell but the ropes around his ankles were too he tripped and fell quirrell ignored he was still talking to does this mirror how does it help and to harrys a voice and the voice seemed to come from quirrell himself the use the quirrell rounded on potter come he clapped his hands and the ropes binding harry fell harry got slowly to his quirrell in the mirror and tell me what you harry walked toward i must he thought i must look and lie about what i thats quirrell moved close behind harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from quirrells he closed his stepped in front of the and opened them he saw his pale and scared looking at but a moment the reflection smiled at it put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood red it winked and put the stone back in its pocket and as it did harry felt something heavy drop into his real somehow incredibly hed gotten the said quirrell do you harry screwed up his see myself shaking hands with he ive won the house cup for quirrell cursed out of the he as harry moved he felt the sorcerers stone against his dare he make a break for but he hadnt walked five paces before a high voice though quirrell wasnt moving his he come back quirrell me the what did you just the high voice spoke me speak to face to you are not strong have strength for harry felt as if devils snare was rooting him to the he couldnt move a he watched as quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his what was going the turban fell quirrells head looked strangely small without then he turned slowly on the harry would have but he couldnt make a where there should have been a back to quirrells there was a the most terrible face harry had ever it was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for like a it harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldnt what i have the face shadow and vapor i have form only when i can share anothers but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and unicorn blood has strengthened these past you saw faithful quirrell drinking it for me in the and once i have the elixir of i will be able to create a body of my why dont you give me that stone in your so he the feeling suddenly surged back into harrys he stumbled be a snarled the save your own life and join or youll meet the same end as your they died begging me for harry shouted quirrell was walking backward at so that voldemort could still see the evil face was now it always value your parents were i killed your father and he put up a courageous but your mother neednt have she was trying to protect now give me the unless you want her to have died in harry sprang toward the flame but voldemort screamed and the next harry felt quirrells hand close on his at a needle sharp pain seared across harrys his head felt as though it was about to split in he struggling with all his and to his quirrell let go of the pain in his head lessened he looked around wildly to see where quirrell had and saw him hunched in looking at his fingers they were blistering before his seize shrieked voldemort and quirrell knocking harry clean off his feet landing on top of both hands around harrys neck harrys scar was almost blinding him with yet he could see quirrell howling in i cannot hold him my hands my and though pinning harry to the ground with his let go of his neck and at his own palms harry could see they looked and kill and be screeched quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly but by reached up and grabbed quirrells face quirrell rolled off his face and then harry quirrell couldnt touch his bare not without suffering terrible pain his only chance was to keep hold of keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a harry jumped to his caught quirrell by the and hung on as tight as he quirrell screamed and tried to throw harry off the pain in harrys head was building he couldnt see he could only hear quirrells terrible shrieks and voldemorts yells kill and other maybe in harrys own he felt quirrells arm wrenched from his knew all was and fell into down something gold was glinting just above the he tried to catch but his arms were too he it wasnt the snitch at it was a pair of how he blinked the smiling face of albus dumbledore swam into view above said harry stared at then he the it was hes got the quick dear you are a little behind the said does not have the who i please or madam pomfrey will have me thrown harry swallowed and looked around he realized he must be in the hospital he was lying in a bed with white linen and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy from your friends and said happened down in the dungeons between you and professor quirrell is a complete the whole school i believe your friends misters fred and george weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet no doubt they thought it would amuse madam felt it might not be very and confiscated long have i been in ronald weasley and miss granger will be most relieved you have come they have been extremely the stone i see you are not to be very the professor quirrell did not manage to take it from i arrived in time to prevent although you were doing very well on your i must got you got hermiones must have crossed in no sooner had i reached london than it became clear to me that the place i should be was the one i had just i arrived just in time to pull quirrell off was feared i might be too nearly i couldnt have kept him off the stone much longer the you the effort involved nearly killed for one terrible moment i was afraid it as for the it has been said harry your friend nicolas flamel you know about said sounding quite did do the thing didnt nicolas and i have had a little and agreed its all for the that means he and his wife will wont have enough elixir stored to set their affairs in order and they will dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on harrys one as young as im sure it seems but to nicolas and it really is like going to bed after a very long after to the well organized death is but the next great you the stone was really not such a wonderful as much money and life as you could the two things most human beings would choose above all the trouble humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for harry lay lost for dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the said been sir even if the stones vol i you know who him always use the proper name for fear of a name increases fear of the thing voldemorts going to try other ways of coming isnt i he hasnt has he has he is still out there perhaps looking for another body to not being truly he cannot be he left quirrell to he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his while you may only have delayed his return to it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time and if he is delayed and he may never return to harry but stopped because it made his head then he there are some other things id like to if you can tell things i want to know the truth dumbledore is a beautiful and terrible and should therefore be treated with great i shall answer your questions unless i have a very good reason not in which case i beg youll forgive i shall of voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing but why would he want to kill me in the first dumbledore sighed very deeply this the first thing you ask i cannot tell not not you will one put it from your mind for when you are i know you hate to hear when you are you will and harry knew it would be no good to why couldnt quirrell touch mother died to save if there is one thing voldemort cannot it is he didnt realize that love as powerful as your mothers for you leaves its own not a no visible to have been loved so even though the person who loved us is will give us some protection it is in your very full of and sharing his soul with could not touch you for this it was agony to touch a person marked by something so dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the which gave harry time to dry his eyes on the when he had found his voice harry the invisibility cloak do you know who sent it to your father happened to leave it in my and i thought you might like dumbledores eyes your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was theres something said snape him quirrell said he hates me because he hated my is that they did rather detest each not unlike yourself and and your father did something snape could never saved his said dumbledore the way peoples minds isnt professor snape couldnt bear being in your fathers i do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father then he could go back to hating your fathers memory in harry tried to understand this but it made his head so he theres one more the did i get the stone out of the im glad you asked me it was one of my more brilliant and between you and thats saying you only one who wanted to find the stone find but not use it would be able to get otherwise theyd just see themselves making gold or drinking elixir of my brain surprises even me enough i suggest you make a start on these bettie botts every flavor i was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored and since then im afraid ive rather lost my liking for them but i think ill be safe with a nice dont he smiled and popped the golden brown bean into his then he choked and ear madam the was a nice but very five harry let professor dumbledore of that was the quite you need am lying down and go madam very she five minutes and she let ron and hermione hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him but harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very we were sure you were going to dumbledore was so worried whole schools talking about said really it was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild harry told them the the and ron and hermione were a very good they gasped in all the right and when harry told them what was under quirrells hermione screamed out the stones said ron just going to what i but dumbledore thinks that what was to the well organized death is but the next great always said he was off his said looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero what happened to you said i got back all said brought ron round that took a while and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall he already knew he just harrys gone after hasnt and hurtled off to the third think he meant you to do said you your fathers cloak and hermione he did i mean to say thats terrible you could have been it said harry a funny i think he sort of wanted to give me a i think he knows more or less everything that goes on you i reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to and instead of stopping he just taught us enough to i dont think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror its almost like he thought i had the right to face voldemort if i dumbledores off his all said ron youve got to be up for the end of year feast the points are all in and slytherin of course you missed the last quidditch we were steamrollered by ravenclaw without you but the foodll be at that madam pomfrey bustled had nearly fifteen now she said after a good nights harry felt nearly back to i want to go to the he told madam pomfrey as she straightened his many candy i cant dumbledore says you are to be allowed to she said as though in her opinion professor dumbledore didnt realize how risky feasts could you have another said is hagrid sidled through the door as he as usual when he was hagrid looked too big to be he sat down next to took one look at and burst into all my ruddy he his face in his i told the evil git how ter get past i told it was the only thing he didnt an i told yeh couldve all fer a dragon ill never drink i should be chucked out an made ter live as a said shocked to see hagrid shaking with grief and great tears leaking down into his hed have found out this is voldemort were talking hed have found out even if you hadnt told couldve sobbed don say the harry and hagrid was so he stopped met him and im calling him by his please cheer we saved the its he cant use have a chocolate ive got hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and reminds ive got yeh a not a stoat is said harry and at last hagrid gave a weak dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix he shoulda sacked me instead got yeh it seemed to be a leather covered harry opened it it was full of wizard smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and owls off ter all yer parents old school askin fer knew yeh didn have dyeh like harry couldnt but hagrid harry made his way down to the end of year feast alone that he had been held up by madam pomfreys fussing insisting on giving him one last so the great hall was already it was decked out in the slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate slytherins winning the house cup for the seventh year in a a huge banner showing the slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the high when harry walked in there was a sudden and then everybody started talking loudly at he slipped into a seat between ron and hermione at the gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at dumbledore arrived moments the babble died year dumbledore said i must trouble you with an old mans wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious what a year it has hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year as i understand the house cup here needs and the points stand in fourth with three hundred and twelve in with three hundred and fifty ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty six and four hundred and seventy a storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the slytherin harry could see draco malfoy banging his goblet on the it was a sickening well said recent events must be taken into the room went very the slytherins smiles faded a said have a few last minute points to dish let me to ronald ron went purple in the he looked like a radish with a bad the best played game of chess hogwarts has seen in many i award gryffindor house fifty gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched the stars overhead seemed to percy could be heard telling the other you my youngest got past mcgonagalls giant chess at last there was silence to miss hermione for the use of cool logic in the face of i award gryffindor house fifty hermione buried her face in her harry strongly suspected she had burst into gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves they were a hundred points to harry said the room went deadly quiet for pure nerve and outstanding i award gryffindor house sixty the din was those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy two points exactly the same as they had tied for the house cup if only dumbledore had given harry just one more dumbledore raised his the room gradually fell are all kinds of said takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our but just as much to stand up to our i therefore award ten points to neville someone standing outside the great hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken so loud was the noise that erupted from the gryffindor and hermione stood up to yell and cheer as white with disappeared under a pile of people hugging he had never won so much as a point for gryffindor still nudged ron in the ribs and pointed at who couldnt have looked more stunned and horrified if hed just had the body bind curse put on dumbledore called over the storm of for even ravenclaw and hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of need a little change of he clapped his in an the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became the huge slytherin serpent vanished and a towering gryffindor lion took its snape was shaking professor mcgonagalls with a forced he caught harrys eye and harry knew at once that snapes feelings toward him hadnt changed one this didnt worry it seemed as though life would be back to normal next or as normal as it ever was at it was the best evening of harrys better than winning at or or knocking out mountain he would ever forget harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to but come they to their great both he and ron passed with good of had the best grades of the first even neville scraped his good herbology mark making up for his abysmal potions they had hoped that who was almost as stupid as he was might be thrown but he had it was a but as ron you couldnt have everything in and their wardrobes were their trunks were nevilles toad was found lurking in a corner of the notes were handed out to all warning them not to use magic over the holidays always hope theyll forget to give us said fred weasley hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the they were boarding the hogwarts talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and eating bettie botts every flavor beans as they sped past muggle pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and pulling into platform nine and three quarters at kings cross it took quite a while for them all to get off the a wizened old guard was up by the ticket letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didnt attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the must come and stay this said of you ill send you an said need something to look forward people jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the muggle some of them said grinning at where im i promise said and hermione passed through the gateway he there he it was ginny rons younger but she wasnt pointing at she i can see and its rude to weasley smiled down at she said for the fudge and the it was are it was uncle still purple still still looking furious at the nerve of carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary behind him stood aunt petunia and looking terrified at the very sight of must be harrys said a manner of said uncle we havent got all he walked harry hung back for a last word with ron and you over the you have er a good said looking uncertainly after uncle shocked that anyone could be so i said and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his dont know were not allowed to use magic at im going to have a lot of fun with dudley this the end\n"
